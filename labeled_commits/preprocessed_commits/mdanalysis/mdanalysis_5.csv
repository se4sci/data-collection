ca72ee9,2015-08-22 11:05:07,work on Amber TRJ format - enhanced the Trajectory API: readers must be able to accept (and   ignore) any keywords. This is necessary to pass the number of atoms   to the Amber TRJ reader  which needs it - updated all readers to accept **kwargs if they hadn't done so already - made the TRJReader work with or without box in the trajectory   (reads the first frame and looks for box information - documented the quirks of the TRJ reader - Amber TRJ reader can also read compressed files - introduced a registry for formats that can do compressed files   (MDAnalysis.coordinates._compressed_formats),0,1.0,0
