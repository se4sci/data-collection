be8db1c,2017-06-28 16:21:54,Gromacs trajectories fixes and improvements - FIXED: trr/xtc tests failed (on Mac OS X) when MDAnalysis was properly installed   as a egg directory but not as a developer install:   - forgot to include the trr and xtc files in the package   - learned that xdrfile_open() segfaults (at least Mac OS X) if     there is no file: added additional check to prevent that - Gromacs XDR reader now behave like DCDReader:   (1) raise IOError when done    (2) continue raising with repeated next() - for some reason  TRR files can (always??) return status exdrINT at end of file  catch   this in _read_next_timestep() - regenerated swig files from libxdrfile.i (only minor doc things),1,1.0,1

b97f2ab,2017-07-02 22:46:35,new attributes for Atom: radius and bfactor - enhanced Atom object with the radius value (read by the PQR reader) and   added radii() to AtomGroup  this should make it easier to handle PQR files - changed the way that B-factors were stored: they are now also store with   each individual Atom. For compatibility with the old behaviour  AtomGroup.bfactors   is still a (managed) attribute but this will likely be changed to a method in   the 0.8 release to have a more uniform interface - Fixed a bug with the Bio.PDB reader: in the absence of a segid in the file it   would throw an error,1,1.0,1
