e15f1be,2017-06-17 16:49:37,removed ALL deprecated and legacy code: OLD CODE MIGHT BREAK - AtomGroup._atoms removed - AtomGroup.principleAxes (Issue 33) - DCD.DCDReader.dcd_header() and DCD.DCDWriter.dcd_header()   (use _dcd_header()) - Universe.dcd (and Universe.xtc  Universe.trr...) --- from   now on only Universe.trajectory is supported.   WILL BREAK LEGACY CODE! - removed the following packages from top-level MDAnalysis   name space: - AtomGroup  Selection: import them from MDAnalysis.core if   really needed (e.g. 'import MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup') - distances  rms_fitting: 'import MDAnalysis.analysis.distances'   or 'import MDAnalysis.analysis.align.rms_fitting' (the   actual modules still live in MDAnalysis.core but they   might get moved in the future and bundled with   transformations) - 'from MDAnalysis import *' will only get ['Timeseries'    'Universe'  'asUniverse'  'Writer'  'collection'] - removed copy flag from distance_array and self_distance_array:   setting it to False would always give wrong results so there was   no good reason keeping it around (also removed the test cases with   known failures),1,0.0,0
