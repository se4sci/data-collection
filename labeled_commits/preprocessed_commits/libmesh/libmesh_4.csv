322db00,2012-11-01 16:08:44,Accidentally made that last commit from an older checkout - here's the new Communicator part of the refactoring and the separate-namespace compatibility fix.,1,1.0,1
6be3d1c,2012-11-01 19:08:17,rbOOmit change: Fixed rb_eim_construction for --enable-parmesh,1,1.0,1
d82a7a6,2012-11-01 19:47:07,rbOOmit change: changed Parallel::sum to Parallel::max in rb_eim_construction to avoid a potential bug when an evaluation point is on a ghosted element. Also  removed parmesh assert in reduced_basis_ex6.,1,1.0,1
38f9d80,2012-11-01 19:54:24,rbOOmit change: fixed up comments related to the change in r6280,1,0.0,0
e9295e0,2012-11-01 21:38:00,I was expecting a cholesky solve to modify the matrix being factored  but not the right hand side too...  Finding that behavior was hell  but changing it seems to be quite cheap.,0,0.0,0

7586b32,2012-11-02 03:33:38,Added a method to get all the variable numbers in a system  since this is useful for setting up a MeshFunction that can access all the variables (as is done in rb_eim_construction.C),0,0.0,0
979a890,2012-11-02 13:49:49,MessageTag::invalid_tag.  Set this to INT_MIN.  Note that we can't use std::numeric_limits<int>::min() (which is equivalent) because that is a function call and not allowed in the initialization of static data in this case.,0,0.0,0

56d5f12,2012-11-05 17:49:11,do not require message tag creation to be done by all processors in DEBUG mode.  there are valid use cases where processor 0 creates tags to send to other processors  but the call cannot be synchronized.,0,0.0,0
7c1b199,2012-11-05 18:04:10,Let's not deprecate Parallel::wait - the vector-of-requests case doesn't really have a new equally-convenient equivalent  and so we might as well leave the single request case in too for symmetry.,0,0.0,0

7fe8025,2012-11-16 15:07:43,"Extend the MeshTools::Generation::build_sphere() function to optionally build what is called an ""icosasphere"" (or  more rarely  ""icosphere""). That is  a regularly triangulated 2D spherical mesh  obtained by iterative refinement of a regular icosahedron. The patch fits quite nicely into the preexisting code. An icosasphere can be built by setting the new flag ""flat"" to false (default true) when building a 2D mesh in 3D space.",1,0.0,0
