bfeabec,2005-06-11 03:59:18,Slew of header file interdependency reduction. Warning: you may have to include more header files in your user code due to the removal of many unnecessary prior inclusions.,0,,0
3b70312,2005-06-11 05:11:31,Reducing header file dependences.  Instead of having a BoundaryInfo object in the MeshBase  we now have an AutoPtr<BoundaryInfo>.  This maintains the same level of safety with regard to garbage collection and removes the boundary_info.h dependency from mesh_base.h. If you have any code which used the mesh.boundary_info.xxx() syntax  you will have to change it to mesh.boundary_info->xxx().  The same idea was used in system.h to hold an AutoPtr<DofMap> rather than a naked pointer.,0,,0
8281432,2005-06-11 06:09:00,Possible performance enhancement in Mesh::delete_elem. We use the passed Elems id() as a guess for the location of the Elem in the _elements vector. If the guess does not succeed  then we revert to the linear search.,0,,0
