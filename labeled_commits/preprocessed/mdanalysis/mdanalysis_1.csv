319e53c,2010-10-03 17:28:45,Summary: patch to resolve issue 43--whitespace is no longer required around the parentheses in selectAtoms strings. In module MDAnalysis/core/Selection.py and class SelectionParser  the method parse(self selectstr) now adds bounding whitespace around the input string so the parser can handle a lack of whitespace. Method __consume_token(self) in the same class has also been streamlined to incorporate the built-in pop() method rather than the more verbose alternative in place. The changes pass the unit test introduced in r456 and the enhancement has been added to the CHANGELOG.,0,,1.0
