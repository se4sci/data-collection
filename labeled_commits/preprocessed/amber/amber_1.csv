I originally didn't use vector since I needed to interface with the NetCDF C routines  but I think I've thoroughly convinced myself that std::vector storage is *always* contiguous.

Output trajectories and actions can now have some idea of whether this metadata is present in input trajectories and act accordingly. For example  time values present in input restarts will now be written to output restarts or netcdf trajectories  and blank time values will no longer be written to output netcdf trajectories when not present in input trajectories. Velocity information will now be correctly included unless 'novelocity' is specified  etc. Some tests  as well as internal version number updated.,0,,0

ecffa36b,2015-02-18 10:34:10,DRR - Cpptraj: Add CpptrajFile list to DataFileList  the idea is to treat raw text output from Actions (like e.g. average solute-solute hbonds from hbond) just like data files.

25021c88,2015-02-18 15:12:50,DRR - Cpptraj: Reorganize and clean up CpptrajFile: use variable to determine if file is a stream instead of empty file name  this allows the FileName class to be set to the name of the stream (and avoid alot of Filename().empty() checks) and should in theory make adding STDIN support easier in the future.,0,,0

0ee9f393,2015-02-19 16:23:35,DRR - Cpptraj: Matrix 'byresidue' output fixed so that a data set is actually created that contains the by residue-averaged matrix  allowing the DataIO framework to be used for output. In the case of 'bymask' output no data set is allocated  just a CpptrajFile*. It is assumed if 'byresidue' or 'bymask' is specified you will not want the 'byatom' matrix later on  so this behavior may need to be changed. 'byresidue' test output precision increased.,1,,0
4bed79a4,2015-02-20 10:30:14,DRR - Cpptraj: More fixes and cleanup for the matrix action. The by-atom matrix is now always saved in the main data set list  if by-residue output is desired an additional matrix is created instead. The topology is no longer saved  all necessary data for averaging is now saved (masses  residues). Clean up averaging by mask. Store number of snapshots in matrix data set (where it really belongs).,1,,0
36b9351b,2015-02-20 14:01:11,DRR - Cpptraj: Matrix types now part of DataSet::scalarType enumerated type. This fixes the issue of certain data sets improperly overloading DataSet::Type  which prevented the base type of these sets from being determined. It simplifies things from a code standpoint (why should there be multiple arrays of types?). Make some exposed arrays in DataSet private (the way they should have been). The 'diagmatrix' routine will now print a warning when a matrix has more columns than snapshots used to generate it  instead of printing this warning when the matrix is generated (which is far more easily lost). Also fix dependencies.,1,,0

fe14a212,2015-02-22 20:03:12,DRR - Cpptraj: Code that delays opening of CpptrajFiles in DataFileList until called upon. Works well in theory and would allow CpptrajFiles to be more easily set up in ensemble mode. The problem is that not every Action or Command writes at the same time (e.g. atommap can write in Init())  so the approach is currently disabled and all CpptrajFiles are opened when added to the list. Needs more work.,1,,0
70533617,2015-02-23 11:00:57,DRR - Cpptraj: Avoid ensemble CpptrajFile name issue by opening with worldrank numerical extension. This will have to change in the future if MPI no longer means 'ensemble only' or if thread division ever changes  but works well right now.,0,,0

c29f1108,2015-03-09 10:17:23,DRR - Cpptraj: Fixes/improvements to the cpptraj AT build process. - Change build targets so that they are consistent with the rest of Amber (i.e. serial  parallel  openmp). This allows a single build rule for cpptraj in AmberTools/src that can be used no matter what the install type. - Add 'libcpptraj' target to AmberTools build and add '-shared' option to standalone configure that can be used to build standalone libcpptraj - prevent the standalone one from being built if not configured with '-shared'. - Remove libcpptraj from the AT serial build target. - Change the pytraj rule from 'make cpptraj' to 'make libcpptraj'  which is actually all it needs. Create separate libcpptraj target for AmberTools since AT/standalone depend on different things (also consistent with how the build is currently split). - Remove obsolete libclean rule. - Do not include the readline library in libcpptraj (probably a lot more stuff that pytraj doesnt need can be removed from the lib as well). - Add standalone uninstall rule. - Remove unused configure_pytraj - should not be necessary.,0,,0

5828025b,2015-08-29 18:44:50,DRR - Cpptraj: Major changes to reference handling. Create separate array to track reference frames in DataSetList.

798b79b3,2015-08-31 10:27:21,DRR - Cpptraj: Another significant change to data set handling in DataIO classes. For output  DataSet routine now has Coords() routine that returns the value of the coordinate instead of writing it to a file  should be more efficient in cases where the same coordinate has to be written over and over. Should be OK  right now there is no case where the coordinate is anything but a double precision value. Fix up Gnuplot output so that TextFormat and DataSet::SizeArray are used. Appending on data set reading is now done at the time of the read - no more buffering and potentially converting from DataSet_double to DataSet_XYMESH. All numerical data sets are now read in as XYMESH  this will cost more memory but is ultimately much easier to maintain - Grace and Std DataIO input both changed this way. Consolidate RemoveSet/PopSet in DataSetList and get rid of obsolete ParseArgString header. Add TextFormat routine for changing format width only.,1,,0
