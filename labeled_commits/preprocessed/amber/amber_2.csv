971da98f,2015-12-15 11:30:38,"DRR - Cpptraj: Fix for output format on windows. It seems that before visual studio 2015 the compilers resulted in printf code that always used 3 digits in exponents whether needed or not  which is not in keeping with the C specification:   ""...The exponent always contains at least two digits  and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the exponent.""

The ensemble and trajectory communicators have been moved from EnsembleIn to Parallel which just makes more sense - no need to create separate communicators for each input trajectory/ensemble. In CpptrajState  add trajectories to trajinList_ inside of SetTrajMode() because during ENSEMBLE SetTrajMode() needs to know about about ensemble communicator ranks  and the ensemble comm is not set up until the ensemble itself is. Use the ensemble/trajectory comms where appropriate instead of the world comm (except in the single ensemble traj  but that is a problem for another day).

61a5c546,2016-02-25 14:39:40,DRR - Cpptraj: Fix calculation of final histogram from 'pairdist' in parallel. Due to the way pairdist resizes the histogram on the fly  it results in different bin counts if the bin is not present on all frames and on all threads. The current way around this is to add a new keyword  maxdist  which sets the histogram initial size to something reasonable so all bins are present. Add a warning if this keyword is not used in parallel. There are differences if the keyword is not used in serial but they tend to be much  much smaller.,1,,0
