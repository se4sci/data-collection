0f7d15d,Added Jacobi quadrature rules. These rules allow for conical product quadrature to be performed on tris and tets.  Although these types of rules are non-optimal (use more points than necessary and cluster points) they are correct  and easy to construct for high orders.  At this time  if you select anything beyond fifth-order quadrature for tets or tris you will get a conical product Gauss-Jacobi rule.  Other changes include fixing a broken 7 point Gauss quadrature rule which had the wrong weights  and making a few functions in the QBase class virtual instead of pure virtual.  This way you can create concrete quadrature classes without implementing anything for 2 and 3D.  The init_1D function is still pure virtual so you will at least need to define 1D quadrature rules if you create a new class.,2018,,,yes,1538848304.521269

1e8674d,"Committing patch from Lorenzo Botti which fixes and improves XYZ finite elements. From his email: ""The major change is related to a scaling introduced to improve the condition number on small and big elements (small and big compared to the reference element). With such a scaling on linear hexs the XYZ is equivalent to a MONOMIAL basis  independently of the element size. On curved elements the approximation properties of this scaled XYZ should be better than MONOMIAL and should allow to go up to a third or fourth degree approximation without any trouble."" Also added miscellaneous_ex8 which is a copy of misellaneous_ex5  but uses XYZ elements instead of MONOMIAL elements. Tested successfully in 2D and 3D.",2018,,,yes,1538842252.529697

fc52d4f,- thanks  John for the hint with the unsigned short int!  Reduced   mem requirements for the adjacent_vertices matrices of all higher-order   elements through converting to short int - reduced # of virtual fn's in Elem by one: the higher_order_equiv_elem()   or so got moved into a static member function of Elem.  This also enables   to choose whether one wants to convert quad4->quad8 or quad4->quad9   through a simple bool option in MeshBase::all_second_order(bool) - reduced repeated code in adjacent_vertices through moving these short   int matrices to Hex  Quad  Prism etc - fixed GMV support for higher-order Prisms (enuff debugging for today...  -),2018,,,yes,1538841562.457052

7dda254,- extended the MeshData to compatible mode: when the  MeshData   was not active at mesh import time  one can still write   a Universal mesh  or read/write mesh data through the   compatibility mode.  However  be cautious with this mode    it uses the _current_ Mesh node and element ids - fixed MeshBase Universal support for Tet10,2018,,,yes,1538841478.540141
1b05f5a,- Added the embedding matrices for the Prism18. - Fixed the ambiguous definition of the Prism reference element...   For the record  it is (xi eta) in the standard reference isoscolese   triangle with zeta in [0 1]  NOT [-1 1].  Sorry about the confusion.   It was wrong in two places in such a way that they cancelled each other   out! - Creating the boundary mesh works again  this time without renumbering the   nodes,2018,,,yes,1538841465.114965

52ae433,added --enable-everything  fixed another perflog issue  started the Parameters class  but needs work.  configure no longer aborts when it does not recognize the compiler  but rather issues a warning that the user will need to manually set the compiler flags in Make.common,2018,,,yes,1538841323.048438
8eab73b,- added _build_ support for 2D infinite elements - fixed nodal_soln for infinite elements - added static member libMesh::zero.  May not be really necessary    but want to be on the safe side: who knows what the default   constructor of std::complex does with only one double passed in. - added container class FEComputeData.  Serves as a hide for   I/O to customized FE classes.  E.g. for the notorious infinite   elements  the compute_data()  using FEComputeData  is the physically   correct counterpart to shape(),2018,,,yes,1538841235.956082
084451d,Fixed element normal calculations for 2D elements living in 3D.  The normal vector now lies in the tangent plane of the element rather than arbitrarily in the x-y plane.,2018,,,yes,1538841233.388931

4326048,Added a new option to the build_cube and build_square mesh generation routines which builds meshes graded into the boundary layers.  The inspiration comes from the Gauss- Lobatto grid points which are commonly used in spectral methods since the Chebyshev polynomials of arbitrary order reduce to cosine evaluations at the G-L points.

56b7f91,Added a build_solution_vector overload in equation_systems which can be used to build (locally) the global solution for a single variable in a single system.  I cant remember why I wanted to do that  the code is untested and has error() in the beginning.  Testing to come.,2018,,,no,1538854922.622347

67ae721,Added a non-const const_elements_begin() function to the MeshBase class.  The reasoning behind this is you may want to enforce const iteration over the elements of a non-const Mesh.  Changed a few places in the code to use this new function.,2018,,,no,1538854876.120608
07726ce,std::abs() already does the right thing for floats.,2018,,,no,1538854869.712778
966da2f,Modifying an original mesh Elem (rather than making and modifying a copy) for ALE is an ugly non-const-correct non-thread-safe hack.  We can at least correct the API for now  and get to the implementation later.,2018,,,no,1538854804.384689

28297b7,Fixed mainly documentation typos.  Also decided that  although BoundaryInfo::sync() can technically be made const  it is not strictly a const function since it *does modify* the mesh which contains it. Specifically  it sets the subdomain_id for some elements on the boundary. The result is that write_diva() back to non-const for now.,2018,,,no,1538854700.493767

92adec8,- reworked the MeshUnvInterface internals:  no need for a /tmp/xyz file   any more that buffers data.  This new method is something like   20%+ faster than the old one.  Tested on linux and hp-ux - added typedefs MeshData::const_node_data_iterator and   MeshData::const_node_data_iterator similar to the iterators for   the elements and nodes in MeshBase.  Convenient when one wants to   iterate directly over the nodes/elements with associated data  e.g.   Dirichlet-type boundary conditions.  Tested on linux and hp-ux,2018,,,no,1538842703.074384

Partiitoner::set_node_processor_ids() was not written to handle such a case.

ccea24d,The _elements and _nodes std::vectors have been moved from MeshBase to Mesh at long last.  There are still several lingering design issues which will have to be addressed when additional Mesh subclasses are actually created.  MeshBase now contains a great deal of pure virtual functions which have to be reimplemented in derived classes.  I am certain not all of them will make sense for every subclass  so we will probably end up with another level of abstraction like UnstructuredMesh and then the actual Mesh class.  For now some additional clean-up is probably required  but the examples are running correctly.

When applied to volumetric meshes (which is not truly intended)  it may happen that the centroid of an adjacent element is closer due to extremely distorted elements,2018,,,undetermined,0

From the abstract PredicatedIterator base class  several concrete classes have already been defined.  They are currently used in the MeshBase class to iterate over the _elements vector.

0efbaea,The partitioners now set a new variable in the Mesh called _n_parts.  This variable was needed since n_subdomains does not map directly to the number of partitions created when using partitioners  and neither does n_processors() since you may partition a mesh on one processor if you wish.  Therefore the partitioners all set the new variable _n_parts in the mesh to allow for this possibility.  The GMV routine now allows you to plot (without error messages) the different partitions of the grid.,2018,,,undetermined,0

ebcef0b,cleaned up the trees a bit and added an option to create a tree from the elements directly  bypassing the nodes.  The obvious extension (that I have not made yet) will use the trees (and PointLocators) to find not only elements but also nodes.  Incidentally  the motivation for this was reading a structured surface mesh with a singular axis that contained a number of points at the same physical location in space.  When the target bin size for the tree was less than the number of coincident points an infinite loop was created...  Charming.,2018,,,undetermined,0
0cb82fa,Made a few methods in MeshCommunication const and introduced the first use of the mutable keyword in the library to allow the operator() method of the point_locator_* classes to be const.

00d0bc0,Added routine to delaunay triangulate a square.,2018,,,undetermined,0
3276f53,moved MeshBase::contract() up to Mesh.  Unfortunately  there is no good way to make MeshBase::delete_elem() efficient  so the old implementation of MeshBase::contract() was (potentially) O(n_elem^2)  and consumed approximately 20 percent of the runtime in ex10.  This new implementation exploits the fact that the elements are stored in a vector (which is why it was moved up to the Mesh class) and is linear in the number of elements.  The new implementation is less that 1 percent of the run time in ex10.,2018,,,undetermined,0
22326a6,Finally implemented the EigenSystem and an interface to the SLEPc eigen solvers. Also include an example ex16 to show how to use the new feature.

This maintains the same level of safety with regard to garbage collection and removes the boundary_info.h dependency from mesh_base.h. If you have any code which used the mesh.boundary_info.xxx() syntax  you will have to change it to mesh.boundary_info->xxx().
