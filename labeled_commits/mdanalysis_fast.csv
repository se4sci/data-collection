b90aea8,H-bond analysis: reading donors/acceptors from psf,2018,,
b4d55bc,Major restructuring of module: - core functions are in core - coordinate readers/writers are in coordinates - topology contains topology parsers - utils: misc - KDTree: copied Thomas Hamelryck's KDTree neighbour search code from Biopython   added copyright boilerplate and Biopython to LICENSE   This code will be used for fast distance selection and H-bond analysis. Loading a psf/dcd universe works  Selecting on the universe works  nothing else tested.,2018,,
b9d4f29,initial work on defining hydrogen bonds,2018,,
842210f,UNSTABLE: fixes in HBond (at least now it runs...),2018,,
4630319,UNSTABLE: fixed __init__.py fles so that we really present the same names in the MDAnalysis name space as before the reorganization,2018,,
ab57ac8,- switched KDTree to using numpy - neighbor searching methods work in principle with selections   (re-implemented some functionality of NeighborSearch using the Atom   data structure instead of the Bio.PDB entities),2018,,
798161f,Basic outline of how to calculate pairs within a given radius for determining H-bonds.,2018,,
3ca7d91,- made bfactors a property of Universe - added dimensions property to AtomGroup (required for AROUND and   POINT selection to work on AtomGroups) - reformatted docs (line breaks  initial white space),2018,,
652d487,New functionality in NeighborSearch: - CoordinateNeighborSearch(): takes coordinate arrays   AtomNeighborSearch(): takes AtomGroups (or anything with a   coordinates()) method. In MDAnalysis we are only using   CoordinateNeighborSearch() at the moment. - New search_list() method to find all A within R of B.,2018,,
4cfbf64,Distance selections: - AROUND and POINT work when applied to a universe (there's still a   bug present that prevents proper use with AtomGroups)  I fixed a bug   that made these selections spit out total garbage or crash - AROUND uses by default KDTree neighbor search and is about 7x faster   than the distance matrix based routine (still  it is even better to   explicitly construct such selections with AtomGroups and   KDTree.NeighborSearch.AtomNeighborSearch),2018,,
b842b018,fixed: threw exception if no atom was found at all  now just returns empty index list,2018,,
5c16948,Let AROUND selection use periodic=True (if available),2018,,
2e4d939,Added order='C' to make clear what the array layout should be  this does not change anything because the numpy default is 'C' anyway.,2018,,
eca9dd9,fixed: typo  entity unwrapping of segment should now really return a segment,2018,,
68dc377,fixed: 'from MDAnalysis import *' did not get Universe and collection into the main name space (in the same way as the old MDAnalysis did),2018,,
0e75b0d,fixed: copy does not take kw args,2018,,
23b347d,Framework to organize flags: setup the core.flags instance in __init__.py and import where necessary. Values can be changed interactively and include error checks on values.,2018,,
85c6124,renamed append() to register() (makes more sense),2018,,
f4e4e92,- cleaned up and added docs - defined specifications and conventions for flag doc strings,2018,,
a33a015,docs: spelt out which routines use KDTree with flags['use_KDTree_routines']=='fast',2018,,
210d85b,docs: more on periodic selections,2018,,
d232c0b,AtomGroup.coordinates() returns a VIEW on the array if it can (copy=False)  the copy=True hack was supposed to help with the old distance array bug but this has been fixed independently. I don't think that we need copy=True here but perhaps one should proceed with some caution. For testing the argument is left in the method.,2018,,
c7e2a6a,- fixed installation bug  can now do 'python setyp.py --prefix=~/my/pydir' at the cost of not installing the docs  however it's not really clear where the docs should go. > - new scheme for labelling UNSTABLE releases: get global revision with svnversion and put this number + 1 into RELESE. This way we weill be able to produce nice svn snapshot tarballs.,2018,,
a0589bb,PSFParser should appear at module top as well (for backward compatibility),2018,,
50a86cb,corrected docs for flags,2018,,
b239d6b,AtomGroup.__init__(): check that the input is an object that can be indexed  if not turn it into a list  This is necessary so that one can use sets as input for AtomGroup  for instance  when manually constructing selections for speed.,2018,,
f71c4e0,New: selection can write snapshot to a pdb file (EXPERIMENTAL) - added a simple PDB writer that does not require Bio.PDB (should rewrite PDBWriter) - added core.util for helper functions like filename mangling - small steps towards a unified trajectory API:   . universe.trajectory points to the reader object   . coord.__init__ advertises readers  writers in dicts,2018,,
fcfd6f1,dummy Biopython when pdb-loading functionality is not needed and Biopythn not available,2018,,
4643eb6,fixed: pdb file output could not be read by Charmm even though it was technical legal pdb 3.2.,2018,,
99000bf,fixed: pdb format was off  apparently one has to strip all spaces from name and resName,2018,,
9371251,some cleanup in PDB writer code + added docs,2018,,
5dfa8ac,- use modern MKL - development release 148,2018,,
f41a5c5,release candidate 1: - updated docs (README  INSTALL) - added examples + short README.txt - cranked RELEASE,2018,,
02e9bce,- CRDWriter added (denniej0) - fixed a bug in PrimitivePDBWriter: would only work if run from a base AtomGroup  not a derived   class such as a segment - updated CHANGELOG and TODO,2018,,
9fb3698,docs update (write AtomGroup),2018,,
a7dc12f,checking in my deleted charmm format and altering title,2018,,
3d207f4,fixed: lone star can not have space  must be '*\n'.,2018,,
9640477,use easy_install for installation - added ez_setup.py - added EasyInstall lines to setup.py - package directory renamed to the package name so that we can use the debug setup - bumped development release number,2018,,
10cbef5,added ez files to MANIFEST  I think they are needed to build fully functional eggs (untested),2018,,
e965b30,improved installability - disabled easy_install - moved fast_numeric install config file - some more docs,2018,,

0992cbb,added lapack lib to libraries (see Issue 17 http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/detail?id=17 ) and documented fast math libs switching via setup.cfg - merged INSTALL from website with current version (should now cover 0.6.0) - lapack should always be in linker line -- added,2018,,
105b25c,added devel instructions from website  added link to online doc which is more recent,2018,,

64c6eba,Addition of new MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines namespace.,2018,,
e2dabb0,MDAnalysis now correctly initializes the namespace for MDAnalysis.visualization. The 2D streamplot code in MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines has been added and appears to function properly.,2018,,
54b2860,MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines adjusted in the following ways: -an ImportError with appropriate message should now be raised when a non-standard dependency of this module is not available (rather than a print statement only) -the only non-standard (i.e.  outside of regular MDAnalysis) module requirement has been simplified to matplotlib.nxutils  and ideally this requirement will eventually be removed because it is a deprecated module of matplotlib (and also an analytical rather than plotting use of matplotlib) -the standard dependencies (MDAnalysis  multiprocessing  numpy  scipy) are now imported in separate statements for improved dependency sanity -a substantial amount of extraneous debugging code has been removed (although a bit more clean-up could likely still be done) -the placeholder main() function has been renamed to generate_streamlines() and the workflow may eventually be adjusted (perhaps encapsulated in a class),2018,,
25afe78,work on (sphinx) documentation for 2D streamplot visualization code: -mdanalysis/package/doc/sphinx/source/index.rst adjusted to include entry for visualization modules -new visualization_modules.rst entry and package/doc/sphinx/source/documentation_pages/visualization/streamlines.rst for pulling in 2D streamplot documentation automatically -major improvements to the documentation in and related to MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines  including an inline example of usage / output plot,2018,,

7bf1676,Rebuilt docs to include new MDAnalysis.visualization modules,2018,,
d79ca74,-MDAnalysis.visualization namespace properly labelled as experimental in the CHANGELOG and Matthieu Chavent credited in authors list for most recent set of changes -Matthieu Chavent added to AUTHORS file and to authors list in documentation conf.py file -Changed the citation format for Chavent  Reddy et al. (2014) for consistency with MDA formatting standards -Python assertion statements in the 2D / 3D streamplot modules have been removed in cases where they perform type checking on user input  but they remain for algorithm-level integrity checks (i.e.  expected array shapes at different stages) -The 2D streamplot code now raises a more useful ImportError message when a user does not have matplotlib installed,2018,,
c37ca71,removed toplevel matplotlib imports,2018,,
457bf8e,MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines_3D adjusted in the following ways: -the assessment of proper grid cube geometries is now less sensitive to floating point equality failure (assertion is now from numpy.testing.assert_almost_equal rather than a conventional equality test) -print statements for debug / progress monitoring have been suppressed (mostly deleted from source code) -the generate_streamlines_3d() function now accepts x y z Cartesian coordinate limits for the analysis instead of automatically calculating the limits of the system  this change is largely motivated by increased consistency with the 2D version of the code in MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines.generate_streamlines(),2018,,

ee0da3c,MDAnalysis now truncates atom numbers when writing .gro files with more than 99 999 atoms  in a manner consistent with genbox in GROMACS 4.6.3. Note that it appears that some GROMACS utilities (i.e.  trjconv) actually write 00000 instead of 0 for the 100 000th atom. Both formats can be read in by MDAnalysis and VMD  and this is (overall) an improvement that allows us to write large .gro files in a workable manner. Fixes #550.,2018,,

c88e3fe,Fixed a bug I must have introduced when trying to make PSF reading faster by preallocating the bond  angle  etc lists  but I was only including the last item that was read in each line - also disabled building of bondlists on each atom for the Bond selection  since noone's using it and it really slows down reading a psf This corresponds to r22 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,

ab34cb3,* in comments: changes to make it compile on Mac OS X 10.3.9 without intel compiler and libs. The current version still compiles as before with intel. * added the numpy includes to rms fitting as well (otherwise it failed for me) This corresponds to r49 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
e76542d,use numpy.linalg (with old Numeric LinearAlgebra it does not work anymore) This corresponds to r50 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
9199c09,fixed: Bug in psf parser would not read charges correctly. Eg 0.900000E-01 would be read as 0.9 and not lead to an exception.

cb29d56,Can calculate the distance array without minimum image by setting bpx=None. This makes sense when working on RMS-fitted trajectories which do not obey the original PBC any more. This code avoids having to use a stupid hack like box = 2*box and is perhaps 25% faster by leaving out minimage() This corresponds to r71 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
5d61666,fixed: AROUND selection (Naveen) This corresponds to r72 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,

c315dc4,LAMMPSParser: one version of the LAMMPSParser that may be useful for MDAnalysis This corresponds to r85 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
eee8a69,LAMMPSParser: proper psf formatting This corresponds to r86 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
d399950,Coordinates now returns a brand new array - doesn't break any of the numtools c functions that don't check for contiguity - long term we should fix the c functions to work properly with non-contiguous arrays This corresponds to r87 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
c770738,Under certain circumstances  numframes is not (yet) defined and then repr throws an exception so I removed numframes from the representation.,2018,,
cfd0d8c,- distance_array bug: need to copy() to get a contigious array - AROUND selection: if periodic = False then do not use minimum image   convention when looking for neighbours. The default is now True to   get the behaviour from previous version of MDAnalysis.   Note: I'm not sure if the AROUND selection is working properly at         all. It didn't work for me before and it needs to be tested         again.,2018,,
af20b16,python xtc reader by Benjamin Hall <hall@biop.ox.ac.uk>  (originally named xtcio.py). Used under GPL 3. This corresponds to r90 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
9109d32,reformatted and moved some functions out of the class. Working but need to integrate into the standard MDAnalysis frame work This corresponds to r91 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
78e0581,updated Naveen's email address and google code url This corresponds to r92 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
f76af61,updated version to 0.5-rc1 in order to put a tar ball up on google code This corresponds to r93 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
fb1c908,Release tar ball.  - Change version to 0.5.0  (.0 signifies alpha status  later use a1  a2  b1  b2    after the patch version)  - Added MANIFEST.in to include doc files and all the necessary header files as they are    not automatically picked up by distutils (apparently  a bug: 'getting C library   sources currently broken--no get_source_files() method in build_clib.py')   Also need to pick up all pyrex files and the docs - Revamped docs a little bit. - NOTE: python setup.py install --prefix=mydir is not working properly  it still         tries to install something in the site-wide dir   Added links to googlecode and a template for acknowledgements. - Tested the sdist and managed to compile bot on MAc OS X and Linux (CentOS 4.2 with   modern numpy (> 1.0.3)) - updated CHANGELOG This corresponds to r94 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,
3e4db21,Make PointSelection use the periodic flag in the same way as AroundSelection  even if it's no working properly at least it's consistent.,2018,,
792533c,* primitive PDB writer: only works if structure was read as a pdb. It   simply replaces the pdb coordinates with the time step coordinates.   For something more complicated we should have segment and residue   lists in MDAnalysis (perhaps save them when reading the psf). * added filename attribute to both DCDReader and PDBReader to make it   easier to write unified code. The other important methods and   attributes are already identically named.,2018,,
b53c031,Added bfactors property to the AtomGroup. It is only set when the structure is loaded from a PDB file. The bfactors array itself is an attribute of the Universe (because it makes no sense to attach it to the time step as it is only defined for a single frame) and handled as a managed attribute in AtomGroups. (Change where bfactors[] resides?),2018,,
67d7a1a,numpy.array only makes a copy if you force it. This should fix the problem with AtomGroup.coordinates() function and distance_array,2018,,
4a76bae,added reference in docs,2018,,
1a7b735,new attribute 'filename' (just initializes to 'dcdfilename') (also previously added to the PDBReader class): By having a common API for PDBReader and DCDReader on can more easily write code that can transparently use either.,2018,,
49099c9,Allow an empty AtomGroup (removed the check for length < 1) so that one can have intermediate selections that don't select anything. This can be useful in 'or'ed selections.,2018,,
85b6118,House keeping: - added generated files to svn:ignore - added a little bit to TODO and made sure that it gets into the tar ball,2018,,
bf338f5,"Issue #6: ""accessing coordinate functions of universe segments fails"" was caused by my previous skipping of the check for an empty AtomGroup. Reverted to previous version.",2018,,
4bbbabf,Added Ben's authorship.,2018,,
b0b650e,streamlined,2018,,
0c907a8,Universe: Convenience functionality for interactive work: if the dcd argument has a extension 'pdb' then we try to load it as a pdb. The dcd exception handling is not robust enough yet (e.g. segmentation faults occur when accessing self.dcd after erroneously loading a dcd) so we cannot do a simple try: load_dcd() ... except IOError.,2018,,
2fb5875,Fixed: check for dcd extension always failed,2018,,
0e1f31a,Added ID keyword,2018,,
57a2bbb,Universe now knows the filename of the psf file it was built from  dcd and pdb instances also have the filename attribute.,2018,,
d70bb1c,fixed: exception did not display psf file name,2018,,
63e9b86,* new water dipole correl time series: calculates the vector of   the dipole moment of a rigid 3-site water model * sanitized formatting of correl.h (sorry) * started using specific Exceptions instead of the generic one,2018,,
37c0aa0,Moved the distance array workaround into the function itself: we simply copy the arrays ourselves and all seems to be fine. For daring souls we provide copy=False and disclaim all responsibility.,2018,,
2a09f62,Only provide setup.cfg.template and let the user copy and modify it. This is better because otherwise local modifications mess up svn.,2018,,
4dc0d3d,Release 0.5.1: bugfixes and some enhancements that accrued over the last few months (see CHANGELOG for details). - LICENSE was updated with the UIUC Open Source License (catdcd code) - updated email addresses etc in README - updated TODO (distance_array bug fixed) - added keyword expansion for some of the doc files so that Id lines are   properly shown,2018,,

cadb75b,reSTified docs and added stub for flag to convert Gromacs nm to A,2018,,
c5b7c4a,Gromacs trajectories fixes and improvements - FIXED: trr/xtc tests failed (on Mac OS X) when MDAnalysis was properly installed as a egg directory but not as a developer install: - forgot to include the trr and xtc files in the package - learned that xdrfile_open() segfaults (at least Mac OS X) if there is no file: added additional check to prevent that - Gromacs XDR reader now behave like DCDReader: (1) raise IOError when done  (2) continue raising with repeated next() - for some reason  TRR files can (always??) return status exdrINT at end of file  catch this in _read_next_timestep() - regenerated swig files from libxdrfile.i (only minor doc things),2018,,
94995d3,notes on what to do when unittests are not running,2018,,
5cc4ef5,bumped release but include devel,2018,,
cb62c94,fixed syntax error in test cases (lost the commit somewhere...),2018,,
5a66788,self_distance_array() docs: clarified input/output requirements (different from distance_array()!,2018,,
24827d9,unittests: new tests for distance_array() and self_distance_array() - added distance array tests  including known failures with copy=False - classified the XTC/TRR tests as slow - updated docs on testing considerably - moved filenames needed for all unittests into separate module NOTE: test target values were obtaine on my Macbook running python 2.6  OS X 10.6.3  this version of MDAnalysis  the should probably be checked against independent evidence such as VMD measure().,2018,,
6ba94a7,libxdr: added function to count the number of frames in a trajectory - read_xtc_numframes() and read_trr_numframes() do the brain-damaged thing and   iterate through all frames  in particular for trr one should be able to do better - maybe cache the frame offsets and in this way implement random access (LOOS seems to be doing   something like this) - added a few simple test cases,2018,,
b1eace6,added numframes to TrjReader as a cached attribute - can get numframes for XTC/TRR but takes a long time when accessed the first time - added test cases - broke correl test case into individual test cases,2018,,
1d76f09,trajectory API: additions - delta and skip_timestep added (compute for XDR trj  hard-code for   single frame formats  read as usual from DCD header) - units: describe the length and time units used (for possible   later automatic conversions) - deprecated DCDReader.dcd_header(): not part of API and not really   supported for XDR  also broken  see Issue 27,2018,,
52a3d0d,trajectory API: derive from base classes - base classes for Reader  Writer  Timestep in coordinates.base: all other Reader/Writer   derive from them  the API is not full spelled out in the base classes  though: see   the comments in the code and the description in the module doc string - added units to all Readers/Writers (purely informative at the moment)  note   that we write Angstrom - added format attribute to all classes - moved DCD.Timestep to base - note: DCDReader and DCDWriter have become new-style classes (inherit from base.Reader <- object...) - moved some common methods into the base classes (eg __del__  __len__  __repr__) but not the full   API - CRDWriter: reorganized so that write() opens and closes the file  similar as PDBWriter    also made all the individual writing methods private,2018,,
d93d7b2,units and unit conversion added - simple conversion facility for units (length  time) in core.units (taken from my hop package) - flag[convert_gromacs_lengths] is set to True: the XTC and TRR reader (tested) and writer (untested)   automatically convert to the base units - define MDAnalysis base units as ps and Angstrom (in flags[]) - added test cases (all pass),2018,,
575da3c,updated CHANGELOG with units,2018,,
9ec2423,updated libxdrfile AUTHORS (OB messed with the original files...),2018,,
4c5ced7,KDTree: fixed compiler warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions,2018,,

7480855.0,Merge branch 'topic/examples',2018,,
e7e20e4,selection writer for VMD  PyMol  CHARMM  Gromacs working - use get_writer() to encapsulate the choosing of an appropriate writer   based on filename or default format (should be implemented similarly for   the single frame writers) and corresponding changes in AtomGroup class - write comments (or not  if commentfmt is None) - can write a preamble comment - use the selection writer for LeafletFinder instead of the simple   VMD writer,2018,,
32679ee,analysis: added native contacts analysis (from AdK/lib/python/AdK/contacts.py),2018,,
787a5a7,additional requirements (I thought this was added already but must have lost it),2018,,
c2ef173,asUniverse() convenience method added to unify input - useful for analysis input: either take a universe  a single   filename (PDB)  or a tuple (topology trajectory) and return   a universe - imported at top level (SUBJECT TO CHANGE!) - also more reST doc for AtomGroup,2018,,
ceca351,contacts analysis: working and added reST docs,2018,,
ff38143,reST docs for top __init__ & canonical licence blurb header,2018,,
521e328,changed minimum requirement to python 2.4 (Most of MDAnalysis probably still works on 2.3 but we have not tested it and there is also new code that uses with_statement  set  etc.),2018,,
652fec1,reST docs for top __init__ & canonical licence blurb header,2018,,
8fa51e0,GROParser added. GROReader to follow.,2018,,
e24330f,Issue #32: sort of fixed (check if a DCD has size 0 and raise IOError  instead of segfaulting,2018,,

3f067a6,moved SelectionError into top level,2018,,
4aaeaae,example scripts improvements and additions - added examples for simple and fancy rms fitting - added graph for the simple fitting - fixed: filename for g(r) example,2018,,
d78b52d,analysis module: added rms fitting (with optionally selection derived from a sequence alignment),2018,,
aae6305,Universe init -  commented out debugging messages when building topology - changed vanilla exceptions to either NotImplementedError or ValueError (until   we define better custom exceptions),2018,,
fc2a737,PSFParser to allow for EXT formatted PSF and selection updates to allow for nucleic acid xstal structure resname codes,2018,,
22959c7,fixed rms_fitting bug,2018,,
a111720,analysis contacts: dcd --> trajectory (although will break for XTC at the moment if no reference structures supplied),2018,,
c3822a2,trajectory reader improvements: slices - XTC/TRR reader can do simple slices by sequential iteration - moved some functionality from DCDReader into the base class TrjReader - added explicitly required methods to TrjReader (cf Trajectory API)   mostly with NotImplementedError - enabled reverse iteration for the DCDReader (but disabled for XTC/TRR   because it would require re-seeking every single frame from the beginning) - UnitTests for slices,2018,,
3683440.0,FIXED: trajectory IObase.convert_time_from_native() did the opposite,2018,,
71c4b8c,"unified parser/coordinate reader entry points - use a two-stage process to clean up the messy loading in Universe   1. determine file type with a ""guess_format()"" function (currently will      simply look at the file extension)   2. look up known file formats (in the sub-modules' top level there are      approriate dictionaries that connect format to the appropriate reader)   3. return the appropriate parser (get_parser_for()) or reader (get_reader_for())   4. load - add new formats to      topology._topology_parsers      coordinates._trajectory_reader - PDBParser: made the first failure for wrong extension more general  but we should not   really get there anymore because we use guess_format/get_parser_for - updated CHANGELOG",2018,,
daa6a4e,parser/coordinate entry points: FIXED: would not allow building of psf-only universe (but now issue a warning),2018,,
87cd8dd,FIXED Issue 33: principleAxes() return values are confusing - new principalAxes() method (correct name  too  as a bonus) that returns   the three eigenvectors directly and does not require unpacking - kept old method bu deprecated it,2018,,
bb29716,Added working GROReader and TestGROReader  and fixed Timestep.numatoms issue,2018,,
309970.0,additional tests for coordinate readers - more GRO tests  coordinates and distances fail at the moment because the GRO reader   does not convert units (TO BE FIXED) - more tests for PDB files - use GRO parser for the XTC and TRR tests instead of PDB (a bit faster and more native),2018,,
1ea6c00,FIXED Issue 34: fixed unitcell for XTC/TRR - box vectors were extracted wrongly - moved rad2deg  _angle  _veclength into coordinates.core (for further use) - added test case,2018,,
71ab28d,"use attribute ""issue"" to mark tests relating to recorded problems so that we can run them separately",2018,,
3b2d102,GRO reader: unitcell and unit conversion - added unit conversion so that the GROReader behaves like all the other readers: it   automatically converts the distances to Angstroem - read unitcell (according to the file format specs)  requires special Timestep   class with the appropriate dimensions property to do the conversion - added some docs to the trajectory API to better explain what is expected of   Timesteps (this was not properly documented) - added more test cases for GRO (note that the precision for comparisons goes down   to a single decimal in some cases  eg when subtracting positions!) - minor clean up in various readers: removed explicit setting of the units attribute: this   is a class attribute and set in the class declaration  no need to set it again in __init__.,2018,,
7377130.0,GRO reader: fixed case with only 3 entries for the unitcell,2018,,
7d963e3,added dt managed attribute to all Readers - computes time between frames in ps - round to 4 decimals to get nice and tidy numbers (the unit conversion   can introduce some small and spurious numerical contamination),2018,,
6f0c4db,GRO reader: fix of fix .. should have run the tests after r341,2018,,
ad58ced,added AUTHORS file,2018,,
96d649c,FIXED: adk_oplsaa.gro test file was not included and some tests failed if done from a non-developer install,2018,,

3ee5997,bumped version to 0.6.4-devel and updated CHANGELOG from the release,2018,,
dccf3cb,Universe and load_new: cleanly load universe from a sole pdb or gro but nothing else - load_new: returns file format and filename or None if no input file (for building   psf-only universes) - load_new: raises TypeError if no reader for the format can be found,2018,,
1939985.0,Added GROWriter - writes from either a Universe or AtomGroup,2018,,
91ac199,FIXED Issue 38: XTC writer broken -  fix provided by Danny Parton - added unit test (passes),2018,,
2fe94c3,added Danny's GRO writer to CHANGELOG before this is forgotten,2018,,
2727bf7,created MDAnalysis.analysis.distances which simply imports from core.distances - distances are useful analysis functions so most people would expect them under analysis - distances are also used for selections so that is why we keep them in core,2018,,
12d816e,Trajectory API: format is now UPPERCASE - the format specifier has been changed to the upper case extension (to be   consistent in naming) - added single frame writers to API definition - new get_writer_for() convenience function - refactored check for compressed file formats into check_compressed_format(),2018,,
d014d41,FIXED Issue 37: simulation box were not converted - added coordinates.core.triclinic_box() and triclinic_vectors() to handle conversion - added function convert_dimensions_to_unitcell() to Writers   and added to the requirements of the Trajectory API - GROWriter: introduced a temporary GROWriterStandard class which will replace the current   GROWriter (which got a DeprecationWarning),2018,,
2c5c85f,dcd-to-xtc conversion working - added example script dcd2xtc.py - hacked a few fixes into the xdr writer to substitute missing parameters   (maybe need to do something similar of dcd writer...) - not well tested,2018,,
cf5b272,Primitive PDB parser that reads simple PDB without a fuzz - added PrimitivePDBReader and parser which just stupidly   read a well-formatted pdb file without raising a stink if the resids   are oddly numbered or multiple atom names occur in the same residue - added permissive=False (default) flag to Universe  True switches on   the primitive readers (right now  only PDB has this distinction) - moved the guess_atom_type/mass/charge functions from PDB into topology.core - added permissive keyword arg to the get_parser_for() and get_reader_for()   functions - added a second dictionary each for the permissive parsers and readers (a bit   of an ugly hack...) - added unit tests for the primitive PDBReader/parser (and all pass),2018,,
3f7c650,topology parsing: file format identifier is now UPPER case,2018,,
13e7f7d,chain reader added (Issue 39) - universe can read a list of files and concatenate them transparently   on the fly: u = Universe(PSF  [DCD_1  DCD_2  ...]) - only basic Trajectory API implemented (no indexing/slicing!) - can mix any formats (!) - added simple test case,2018,,
b57f768,FIXED: AtomGroup.write() failed because it was using lower case file format strings (which were changed in r409),2018,,
738b306,GRO writer: cleaned up and write output within try/finally - put all output formatting strings into class-level dict to make things easier   to change - write file in a safe manner  i.e. always close it via finally clause,2018,,
b8dc525,selection writing improved - cleaned up AtomGroup.write() by using the coordinates.get_writer_for()   function (the standard way to do this nowadays) - added test case - note that get_writer_for() and get_reader_for() are now imported into   MDAnalysis.coordinates,2018,,
21e43b3,Merge branch 'printres',2018,,
cddddc7,Merge branch 'printres',2018,,
52728c8,make AtomGroup.coordinates() return an array of type numpy.float32 by default - distance array needs float32 and when interfacing with I/O this is also   how coordinates are stored so it makes sense to enforce it at this   crucial entry point - LeafletFinder would raise an error when building the adjacency matrix   because the array returned by coordinates() was float64,2018,,
5afb44a,new LeafletFinder example: membrane composition - added memanal-composition.py - cleaned up leaflet.py example (use class from module),2018,,
7510d9a,renamed bilayer analysis script to adhere to common scheme membrane-XXX.py,2018,,
ca5d447,added Dannys AtomGroup enhancements to CHANGELOG (sort of backport from the 0.6.4 branch),2018,,
fa19a40,0.6.4 release --- final adjustments (including using canonical GROWriter) - release set to 0.6.4 - removed original GROWriter and replaced with GROWriterStandard (should be invisible to most   users because GROWriter could only be used explicitly anyway).   The olf GROWriter functionality of writing the whole universe can be simply obtained by passing   the universe's universe.atoms AtomGroup to the write() method - cherry-picked from 0.6.4 branch and adjusted,2018,,
1986ac1,release 0.6.4 (no code changes relative to 0.6.4-rc1  only docs) -- updated docs,2018,,
560ca41,FIXED Issue 41: with statement not recognized in PDB.py under python 2.5,2018,,
2e9b865,The docstrings for the four analysis modules located in MDAnalysis/analysis/ have been modified to a reasonably consistent reStructuredText format to produce readable html pages (under doc/html/) built from the Sphinx source (at doc/sphinx/). The file doc/index.html has been removed as this was an old build for the MDAnalysis website. Docstring changes to distances.pyx were necessary as some objects were imported from this module by analysis/distances.py.,2018,,
fd8866d,sphinx sources for docs,2018,,
fe46507,generated html docs from reST sources via sphinx,2018,,
d6e790c,added Tyler to AUTHORS,2018,,
6ee42c3,additional testcases - added testcases for selections (but need more)   NOTE: testcase for Issue 43 (parenthesis without spaces) will currently throw and ERROR         until Issue 43 is fixed - added initial testcases for important methods of AtomGroup,2018,,
319e53c,Summary: patch to resolve issue 43--whitespace is no longer required around the parentheses in selectAtoms strings. In module MDAnalysis/core/Selection.py and class SelectionParser  the method parse(self selectstr) now adds bounding whitespace around the input string so the parser can handle a lack of whitespace. Method __consume_token(self) in the same class has also been streamlined to incorporate the built-in pop() method rather than the more verbose alternative in place. The changes pass the unit test introduced in r456 and the enhancement has been added to the CHANGELOG.,2018,,
e38e52a,backported log for 0.6.4.1 to CHANGELOG and added Tyler for fix of Issue 43,2018,,
34cd627,nativecontacts example - added example script that makes the figure (works for me) - contacts.py: removed deprecated usage for Universe and added load() method   to simply read an existing contacts file - added and improved docs - added q1-q2 figure for DIMS AdK,2018,,
f100480,reader() and writer() factory functions - coordinates.core.reader() returns the appropriate Reader instance for filename - coordinates.core.writer(filename  numatoms) gets a Writer instance  kwargs   are passed on to the actual Writer class - updated docs - removed get_writer_for from the general import statements in favour of   writer() - added docs - tests seem to pass,2018,,
518ca5d,"writing of selections to trajectories - Writer class gained new high-level write() method which can take   either a Timestep  a Universe  or a AtomGroup. The atoms contained in   the argument are written as the next frame to the trajectory. - AtomGroup gained the ""ts"" property  which builds a Timestep on the fly   only containing the coordinates of the atoms in the group. frame and   unitcell are copied from the parent trajectory. - At the top level  import the coordinates.core.writer() factory function   as Writer to make it clearer for the user that it provides a Writer()   class instance. - updated Trajectory API (and all writer classes)",2018,,
42e557f,AtomGroup can be translated and rotated - added translate() and rotate() methods to AtomGroup - this will go into 0.7 so I bumped version to 0.7.0-devel,2018,,
4cd5c78,added transformations module - transformations.py and transformations.py are Copyright Christoph Gohlke    published under the Revised BSD Licence (GPC compatible) - obtained from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/ - This is a bit overkill but we might be able to use more of these functions   for homogeneous coordinates later for more model building  see   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates and   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix for an introduction,2018,,
c47b518,rotateby() method for AtomGroup and use of AtomGroups instead of arrays - uses transformations to compute the transformation matrix - allows use of AtomGroups to specify axis and point or absolute   cartesian coordinates - allow AtomGroup tuple for translate() - fixed (?) rotate() -- not sure if it properly updated _pos,2018,,
529a2bf,added centroid() to AtomGroup and Atom - synonym for centerOfGeometry() and pos - allows using Atoms instead of AtomGroups in the translate() and rotateby()   methods,2018,,

06ecf2e,new exception NoDataError,2018,,
f945075,FIXED Issue 46: failed to write Segment  Residue  ResidueGroup - need to make sure to access the underlying list of atoms - also fixed an unreported issue in the CRDWriter  which wrote the wrong number of   atoms for a selection - simplified code in CRDWriter,2018,,
d13722c,fixes for writing selections - fixed test for selection writin  which gave a false positive - fixed GROWriter,2018,,
5c09783,added tests for Issue 46 and Issue 47 - Issue 46 passes (except for CRD because CRD Reader is missing  see Issue 40) - Issue 47 fails (because no solution is implemented yet),2018,,
4e727ff,FIXED Issue 47 (attribute residue selection from segname now always returns a ResidueGroup) - changes old undocumented behaviour and MIGHT BREAK CODE - also documented the Segment.r<resid> selection but made it 1-based   (makes more sense from the user point of view as all structures/topologies start   numbering at 1 and not at 0 - updated CHANGELOG - tests pass (including the one for Issue 47),2018,,
1e45292,minor changes to tests of fixed issues (added issue attribs and changed text),2018,,
aa1f7e4,removed ALL deprecated and legacy code: OLD CODE MIGHT BREAK - AtomGroup._atoms removed - AtomGroup.principleAxes (Issue 33) - DCD.DCDReader.dcd_header() and DCD.DCDWriter.dcd_header()   (use _dcd_header()) - Universe.dcd (and Universe.xtc  Universe.trr...) --- from   now on only Universe.trajectory is supported.   WILL BREAK LEGACY CODE! - removed the following packages from top-level MDAnalysis   name space: - AtomGroup  Selection: import them from MDAnalysis.core if   really needed (e.g. 'import MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup') - distances  rms_fitting: 'import MDAnalysis.analysis.distances'   or 'import MDAnalysis.analysis.align.rms_fitting' (the   actual modules still live in MDAnalysis.core but they   might get moved in the future and bundled with   transformations) - 'from MDAnalysis import *' will only get ['Timeseries'    'Universe'  'asUniverse'  'Writer'  'collection'] - removed copy flag from distance_array and self_distance_array:   setting it to False would always give wrong results so there was   no good reason keeping it around (also removed the test cases with   known failures),2018,,

aed5881,AtomGroup: indexing reworked  implemented advanced slicing (Issue 36) - indexing of AtomGroup now always behaves like a list: integer --> Atom  slice --> AtomGroup  list/array --> AtomGroup (NEW  fixes Issue 36) - added test cases and modified older test cases (basically  atoms[:] cannot   be used to test for equality as it is now a AtomGroup  use ._atoms. - updated CHANGELOG (reorganized with a big AtomGroup section),2018,,
6a8f62e,test cases: addressing Issue 45: deleting universes in test cases (in tearDown) to reduce memory footprint --- needs to be tested,2018,,
fba0d98,completed FIX of Issue 45 - delete universes in tearDown() AND any references held in other data structures - reduced the maximum memory footprint to <512MB (roughly) of one test process - tests run faster again (with --processes=2 I get 109s on my MacBook Pro 2-core for ~170 tests,2018,,
1307d9d,transformations: removed print() function (not needed and introduces backwards incomaptibilities),2018,,
207223f,release candidate 1 for 0.7.0,2018,,

0a73248,added start_logging() and stop_logging() functions to top level - simple setup for a default logger - must be manually activated or a script must setup its own logger (see docs),2018,,
48f2fb2,analysis.align: quick hacks to make it work again - must use an atom selection for the writer (workaround for Issue 49 when writing to a PDB or GRO) - added tol_mass parameter to avoid raising an exception for small mass differences (e.g. when   one structure is defined via a psf and the other via a pdb with atom mass heuristics) - fixed the progress counter (maybe use analysis.util.progress_meter instead?),2018,,
52f1642,fixed: stop_logging(),2018,,
9b963c6,FIXED Issue 50: can write DCDs again - only minor things needed to correct this - also removed deprecated dcdfilename attribute,2018,,
4419adf,Trajectory API: added totaltime attribute to base.Reader - totaltime = dt * numframes - added test cases - made DCDReader error messages slightly more verbose,2018,,
691d22f,CRD reader and test case,2018,,
4edd6be,CRD Reader and Writer now in both standard and extended formats,2018,,
7554fb4,rc3 with CRD reader (CRD PSF parser still missing and leads to unit test errors),2018,,
b37a7b5,CHARMM CRD format: fixed a few inconsistencies in the Writer - TotRes is really 5 digits wide (not 4)  - x y z are 10 wide (not 9) - should have been not really a problem because we had simply padded the   fields so everything was in the right colum  technically  one could have had problems for totres > 9999   and coordinates >99999.999 - make sure to strip to larger values when writing extended format,2018,,
8bfa301,tests: made coordinates test work consistently  also for crd - changed precisions to match the file format (e.g. 3 for pdb and 5   for crd)  otherwise the tests do not pass consistently) - new crd file that matches the small pdb so that we can use the same   tester class,2018,,
4bb7156,added CRD parser for quick and dirty topology building from CHARMM card coordinate file,2018,,
adc66ca,updated TODO: removed fixed stuff  added new ideas,2018,,
7603305.0,coordinate tests: make sure that for Gromacs tests the conversion flag is set correctly - set core.flags[convert_gromacs_lengths] explicitly in setUp - encountered failures (possibly when running multiple tests with --processes=8) which   came about because the conversion flag was set to False even though it should have   been True,2018,,
b869469,Trajectory API: clarified use of Writer write() method in response to Issue 49 - no code changes  only docs - Trajectory writers can take a Timestep as a rgument to write() - Frame writers only take a AtomGroup or a Universe for write(),2018,,
2edbb91,test datafiles: fixed import list CRD_small -> CRD,2018,,
6ff313f,Frame writer can take a Universe (fixes one half of Issue 49) - added universe attribute to Universe - altered GRO  CRD  and PrimitivePDB writer so that they can   deal with a Universe as argument (just get the coordinates from   the atoms instead of the 'selection' --- no performance penalty    just making use of the improved hierarchy and the fact that   .atoms is now a true AtomGroup) - added test case (passes),2018,,
7129ae7,use PrimitivePDBReader as default PDB reader - Bio.PDB's reader can drop atoms when they have the same name   in a residue (which happens for systems generated from MD simulations)   The PrimitivePDBReader copes just fine with thos cases (but does   not handle esoteric PDB features such as alternative atoms and   insertion codes that are not needed for handling MD simulation data). - The default behaviour of MDAnalysis can be set through the flag       MDAnalysis.core.flag['permissive_pdb_reader']   The default is True. - One can always manually select the PDB reader by providing the   permissive keyword to Universe  e.g. Universe(... permissive=False)   will read the input file with the Bio.PDB reader. This might be   useful when processing true Protein Databank PDB files.,2018,,
9dd0cc7,updated CHANGELOG with denniej's CRD additions (from http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/wiki/ReleaseNotes070 ),2018,,
0d30f46,started 0.7.1 development,2018,,
97e5ab6,fixed race conditions in test suite - any tests that relied on values of the internal flags have been   changed so that they set behaviour through keyword arguments instead    of manipulating flags - affects gromacs conversion of length (GRO  XTC  TRR) with the convert_gromacs_length   flag and the use of the permissive PDB reader (permissive_pdb_reader flag) - tests could fail when they were performed in parallel and different test threads   changed the global flags - added a fes tests to check for the default values but DO NOT USE THE FLAGS during   testing,2018,,

This works well       but keep in mind that this obtains the docs from imported modules  works best       with developer installation (i.e. ""python setup.py develop"") - ""make html"" works fine for me",2018,,

b2c933b,work on Amber TRJ format - enhanced the Trajectory API: readers must be able to accept (and   ignore) any keywords. This is necessary to pass the number of atoms   to the Amber TRJ reader  which needs it - updated all readers to accept **kwargs if they hadn't done so already - made the TRJReader work with or without box in the trajectory   (reads the first frame and looks for box information - documented the quirks of the TRJ reader - Amber TRJ reader can also read compressed files - introduced a registry for formats that can do compressed files   (MDAnalysis.coordinates._compressed_formats),2018,,

23a1bb7,Support for PDBs with 4 character resnames and segID output when writing (PrimitivePDBWriter) (Issue 63  patch by dcaplan) - When I try to read and write PDBs with 4 character resnames used in NAMD/VMD I end up with an improperly formatted PDB file. This is also an issue with segIDs not being written. - I've made a quick patch where I add support for 4 character resnames and change the format string for the output to write the segID. I also added very simple support for better guessing of atom types since the function guess_atom_type was just returning 0. - I'm still not sure about how to deal with the 2 types of format strings for writing PDBs.,2018,,

44eb889,fixed: PDB writer would fail if atom type was an integer - use new guess_atom_element() which right now just does the same as guess_atom_type()   to always guess the element from the atomname - improved guess_atom_type() by also checking for names that start with numbers   such as some hydrogen atoms,2018,,
58644cc,guess_atom_types(): added more ions (mostly GROMOS) and unit test,2018,,
61add54,topology: moved atom types and masses into separate tables - new topology.tables module (can be later expanded to read tables from files) - added more masses and atom types (using CHARMM top_all27 and Gromacs atommass.dat) - added unit tests for masses (note: atomtype/masses test cases are incomplete... TODO)- new functions: get_atom_mass() and guess_atom_element() that do not do much yet  but will allow finer grained control later,2018,,

9ecb534,new attributes for Atom: radius and bfactor - enhanced Atom object with the radius value (read by the PQR reader) and   added radii() to AtomGroup  this should make it easier to handle PQR files - changed the way that B-factors were stored: they are now also store with   each individual Atom. For compatibility with the old behaviour  AtomGroup.bfactors   is still a (managed) attribute but this will likely be changed to a method in   the 0.8 release to have a more uniform interface - Fixed a bug with the Bio.PDB reader: in the absence of a segid in the file it   would throw an error,2018,,

20253fa,TrajectoryReader gained new Writer() method that returns an appropriate TrajectoryWriter for the read trajectory,2018,,
db97ed4,analysis.align: streamlined rms_fit_trj() and alignto()  use common 'select' interface - consistent usage of 'mobile' and 'reference' set - fasta2select() returns dict with 'mobile' and 'reference' keys (MIGHT BREAK OLD   CODE ... but I don't think anyone used this) - the common select code _process_selection() has a hack to accept the old   'target' key instead of 'mobile' until 0.8 - test cases: added unit test for rmsd() and had to adjust the value for   the rms_fit_trj() test case (not really sure why but at least it's consistent   with what VMD shows),2018,,
4d43e92,regenerate online docs (updated Trajectory API and align),2018,,

ca30f66,comment on benchmarking sqrt(dot(v v)) vs numpy.linalg.norm (first one is 3x faster),2018,,
0d37e3c,patch for Issue 57 by jandom,2018,,
d1ffce7,fixed Issue 57: optimized patch and added test case - moved the coordinate check out of the loop and test the whole coordinate array in one   go (better performance but error reporting is worse because we do not report the offending   atom anymore) - remove the opened PDB file before raising the ValueError - added test case (should have had one for PrimitivePDBWriter anyway...),2018,,
241afbf,relaxed test for MDAnalysis.analysis.align.rmsd: rmsd(A B) == rmsd(B A) only has to be equal to 5 decimals (jandom reported some spurious test failures in Issue 57),2018,,
f28ec8b,updated CHANGELOG with recent 0.7.3 changes,2018,,
f0b2076,patch 57b by jandom: completes the fix of Issue 57 (coordinate checking of GRO/PDB writers) - From http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/gro.html    - position (in nm  x y z in 3 columns  each 8 positions with 3 decimal places)    - velocity (in nm/ps (or km/s)  x y z in 3 columns  each 8 positions with 4 decimal places)   Does that mean a max values of 9999.999/-999.999 for coords and same for velocities  but with the decimal moved a digit to left? - added validation for gro writing  moved the coordinate checking method to parent writer class.,2018,,
3ace9d4,"test case for writing GRO files and optimization of fixes for Issue 57 - testing for writing GRO and limits ( -999.994 nm < x < 9999.994 nm ) - sharpened test for PDB limits ( -999.994 A < x < 9999.994 A)  note units A vs nm - conceivably we could include the boundaries into the legal values (they still round down)    if we do then we need to adjust the tests - legal coordinates check for GRO: moved out to before the file is even opened so we can get   rid of removing the opened file - GRO writer: use ""with open() as ..."" instead of ""try: ... finally: close()""",2018,,
46cc00d,changed legal coordinate values for GRO and PDB - limits -999.9995/9999.9995 - changed the actual check to min < x <= max (see Issue 57 comment #7) - tests: the min test is ok  the max test relies on <= and somehow does not   sharply discriminate  e.g. for GRO 9999.9996 passes and for PDB 9999.9951   passes. Not sure what's going on but I made the tests a little bit weaker   (PDB: 9999.996  GRO: 9999.999). In practice it probably won't matter...,2018,,
0114e6a,converted all TABs to spaces (Issue 69) - used emacs 'untabify' on all files  see   http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/detail?id=69#c1 - unit tests pass - TODO: add marker lines for editors (do this together with a   fix for Issue 68),2018,,
87977a3,added comment and formatting header to files (Issue 68 and Issue 69) - name  url  copyright and licence (GPL v2+)  Issue 68 - citation information (need to update once full citation available) - modelines for emacs and vim to ensure that no TABs are use (Issue 69) - might have to take a closer look at the licences of the bundled packages   and customize their comment headers,2018,,
67e1102,fixed: units.py must be in UTF-8,2018,,
1adeb82,CRDReader streamlined and improved - fixed default unit as Angstrom  but that did not   have any influence on the behaviour so far) - added official CRD format to the comments for future reference - improved robustness of EXT detection by using a staged detection of   lines (continue blocks) and checking length of fields - added additional sanity check on the number of atoms (which we can   get from the CRD header),2018,,
d9b741c,added original HELANAL (Python) code by Benjamin Hall - LICENCE: not free  DO NOT DISTRIBUTE yet - not integrated  this is the code as provided by Ben,2018,,

1000dd5,HELANAL helix analysis (integrated Ben Hall's Python implementation) - Ben's code is licensed under the GPL v2+ - http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/users/kumarsan/HELANAL/helanal.html - reference: Bansal M  Kumar S  Velavan R.  HELANAL - A program to   characterise helix geometry in proteins. J Biomol Struct Dyn. 2000  17(5):811-9. - requires universe and start and stop residue of the helix to be analyzed    write a number of output files - not fully tested! - numpified  removed support code for vector handling and trajectory I/O   (now all done with numpy or MDAnalysis)  added docs,2018,,
