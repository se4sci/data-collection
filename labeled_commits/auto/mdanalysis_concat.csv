19,319e53c,Summary: patch to resolve issue 43--whitespace is no longer required around the parentheses in selectAtoms strings. In module MDAnalysis/core/Selection.py and class SelectionParser  the method parse(self selectstr) now adds bounding whitespace around the input string so the parser can handle a lack of whitespace. Method __consume_token(self) in the same class has also been streamlined to incorporate the built-in pop() method rather than the more verbose alternative in place. The changes pass the unit test introduced in r456 and the enhancement has been added to the CHANGELOG.,1538151132.447825,1

84,6ff313f,Frame writer can take a Universe (fixes one half of Issue 49) - added universe attribute to Universe - altered GRO  CRD  and PrimitivePDB writer so that they can   deal with a Universe as argument (just get the coordinates from   the atoms instead of the 'selection' --- no performance penalty    just making use of the improved hierarchy and the fact that   .atoms is now a true AtomGroup) - added test case (passes),1538150814.461738,1
85,8aa93ba,Velocities may now be accessed from GRO files as AtomGroup.velocities() or Atom.velocity   A velocity unit test was included with this commit to verify that both the AtomGroup and Atom-specific velocity reading functionalities are preserved for GRO files.

89,23a1bb7,Support for PDBs with 4 character resnames and segID output when writing (PrimitivePDBWriter) (Issue 63  patch by dcaplan) - When I try to read and write PDBs with 4 character resnames used in NAMD/VMD I end up with an improperly formatted PDB file. This is also an issue with segIDs not being written. - I've made a quick patch where I add support for 4 character resnames and change the format string for the output to write the segID. I also added very simple support for better guessing of atom types since the function guess_atom_type was just returning 0. - I'm still not sure about how to deal with the 2 types of format strings for writing PDBs.,1538150717.927049,1

94,aed5881,AtomGroup: indexing reworked  implemented advanced slicing (Issue 36) - indexing of AtomGroup now always behaves like a list: integer --> Atom  slice --> AtomGroup  list/array --> AtomGroup (NEW  fixes Issue 36) - added test cases and modified older test cases (basically  atoms[:] cannot   be used to test for equality as it is now a AtomGroup  use ._atoms. - updated CHANGELOG (reorganized with a big AtomGroup section),1538150577.284082,1

211,ee0da3c,MDAnalysis now truncates atom numbers when writing .gro files with more than 99 999 atoms  in a manner consistent with genbox in GROMACS 4.6.3. Note that it appears that some GROMACS utilities (i.e.  trjconv) actually write 00000 instead of 0 for the 100 000th atom. Both formats can be read in by MDAnalysis and VMD  and this is (overall) an improvement that allows us to write large .gro files in a workable manner. Fixes #550.,1538150060.517109,1

225,f0b2076,patch 57b by jandom: completes the fix of Issue 57 (coordinate checking of GRO/PDB writers) - From http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/gro.html    - position (in nm  x y z in 3 columns  each 8 positions with 3 decimal places)    - velocity (in nm/ps (or km/s)  x y z in 3 columns  each 8 positions with 4 decimal places)   Does that mean a max values of 9999.999/-999.999 for coords and same for velocities  but with the decimal moved a digit to left? - added validation for gro writing  moved the coordinate checking method to parent writer class.,1538149421.9912028,1

229,97e5ab6,fixed race conditions in test suite - any tests that relied on values of the internal flags have been   changed so that they set behaviour through keyword arguments instead    of manipulating flags - affects gromacs conversion of length (GRO  XTC  TRR) with the convert_gromacs_length   flag and the use of the permissive PDB reader (permissive_pdb_reader flag) - tests could fail when they were performed in parallel and different test threads   changed the global flags - added a fes tests to check for the default values but DO NOT USE THE FLAGS during   testing,1538149362.076686,1

231,fba0d98,completed FIX of Issue 45 - delete universes in tearDown() AND any references held in other data structures - reduced the maximum memory footprint to <512MB (roughly) of one test process - tests run faster again (with --processes=2 I get 109s on my MacBook Pro 2-core for ~170 tests,1538149345.082166,1
232,48f2fb2,analysis.align: quick hacks to make it work again - must use an atom selection for the writer (workaround for Issue 49 when writing to a PDB or GRO) - added tol_mass parameter to avoid raising an exception for small mass differences (e.g. when   one structure is defined via a psf and the other via a pdb with atom mass heuristics) - fixed the progress counter (maybe use analysis.util.progress_meter instead?),1538149341.885909,1
233,d1ffce7,fixed Issue 57: optimized patch and added test case - moved the coordinate check out of the loop and test the whole coordinate array in one   go (better performance but error reporting is worse because we do not report the offending   atom anymore) - remove the opened PDB file before raising the ValueError - added test case (should have had one for PrimitivePDBWriter anyway...),1538149336.128259,1

240,d014d41,FIXED Issue 37: simulation box were not converted - added coordinates.core.triclinic_box() and triclinic_vectors() to handle conversion - added function convert_dimensions_to_unitcell() to Writers   and added to the requirements of the Trajectory API - GROWriter: introduced a temporary GROWriterStandard class which will replace the current   GROWriter (which got a DeprecationWarning),1538149179.233055,1
241,9ecb534,new attributes for Atom: radius and bfactor - enhanced Atom object with the radius value (read by the PQR reader) and   added radii() to AtomGroup  this should make it easier to handle PQR files - changed the way that B-factors were stored: they are now also store with   each individual Atom. For compatibility with the old behaviour  AtomGroup.bfactors   is still a (managed) attribute but this will likely be changed to a method in   the 0.8 release to have a more uniform interface - Fixed a bug with the Bio.PDB reader: in the absence of a segid in the file it   would throw an error,1538149169.434523,1

245,44eb889,fixed: PDB writer would fail if atom type was an integer - use new guess_atom_element() which right now just does the same as guess_atom_type()   to always guess the element from the atomname - improved guess_atom_type() by also checking for names that start with numbers   such as some hydrogen atoms,1538149153.353602,1
246,8b07211,updated a number of examples - write figures to ./figures subdirectory - write data to ./output - added example output and figures for blocks.py  backbone_dihedrals.py    radial_distribution_function.py - fixed/update a number of examples   - blocks.py: block averaging (see example in the paper)   - radial_distribution_function.py: g(r)  this is the optimized version     (see paper) with correct normalisation   - backbone_dihedral.py: example for Timeseries.Collection and use of the     new special Residue.phi_selection() and Residue.psi_selection() methods     for the common backbone dihedrals  script is now ran on the DIMS AdK     trajectory and produces a figure   - TODO: other scripts - made all scripts executable,1538149146.304891,1

249,1adeb82,CRDReader streamlined and improved - fixed default unit as Angstrom  but that did not   have any influence on the behaviour so far) - added official CRD format to the comments for future reference - improved robustness of EXT detection by using a staged detection of   lines (continue blocks) and checking length of fields - added additional sanity check on the number of atoms (which we can   get from the CRD header),1538149048.71708,1

252,4cfbf64,Distance selections: - AROUND and POINT work when applied to a universe (there's still a   bug present that prevents proper use with AtomGroups)  I fixed a bug   that made these selections spit out total garbage or crash - AROUND uses by default KDTree neighbor search and is about 7x faster   than the distance matrix based routine (still  it is even better to   explicitly construct such selections with AtomGroups and   KDTree.NeighborSearch.AtomNeighborSearch),1538149031.200701,1
253,4e727ff,FIXED Issue 47 (attribute residue selection from segname now always returns a ResidueGroup) - changes old undocumented behaviour and MIGHT BREAK CODE - also documented the Segment.r<resid> selection but made it 1-based   (makes more sense from the user point of view as all structures/topologies start   numbering at 1 and not at 0 - updated CHANGELOG - tests pass (including the one for Issue 47),1538148902.1212869,1

259,b37a7b5,CHARMM CRD format: fixed a few inconsistencies in the Writer - TotRes is really 5 digits wide (not 4)  - x y z are 10 wide (not 9) - should have been not really a problem because we had simply padded the   fields so everything was in the right colum  technically  one could have had problems for totres > 9999   and coordinates >99999.999 - make sure to strip to larger values when writing extended format,1538148886.712932,1
260,6ee42c3,additional testcases - added testcases for selections (but need more)   NOTE: testcase for Issue 43 (parenthesis without spaces) will currently throw and ERROR         until Issue 43 is fixed - added initial testcases for important methods of AtomGroup,1538148880.240731,1
261,d399950,Coordinates now returns a brand new array - doesn't break any of the numtools c functions that don't check for contiguity - long term we should fix the c functions to work properly with non-contiguous arrays This corresponds to r87 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1538148870.488982,1
262,9199c09,fixed: Bug in psf parser would not read charges correctly. Eg 0.900000E-01 would be read as 0.9 and not lead to an exception. This means that anything done with MDAnalysis and charge analysis in the past needs to be rechecked. I referencedd the Charmm source code for the authoritative PSF format. This corresponds to r51 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1538148866.247519,1
263,c88e3fe,Fixed a bug I must have introduced when trying to make PSF reading faster by preallocating the bond  angle  etc lists  but I was only including the last item that was read in each line - also disabled building of bondlists on each atom for the Bond selection  since noone's using it and it really slows down reading a psf This corresponds to r22 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1538148864.4314241,1
264,6975481.0,fixed: some tests did not remove temporary files - added forgotten import os so that files get properly unlinked - problem was silently ignored because I had put it in an indiscriminate   try...except: pass block... d'oh - now only pass if os.unlink(temp) produces OSError  otherwise raise,1538148847.16022,1
265,67d7a1a,numpy.array only makes a copy if you force it. This should fix the problem with AtomGroup.coordinates() function and distance_array,1538148830.561439,1
266,c7e2a6a,- fixed installation bug  can now do 'python setyp.py --prefix=~/my/pydir' at the cost of not installing the docs  however it's not really clear where the docs should go. > - new scheme for labelling UNSTABLE releases: get global revision with svnversion and put this number + 1 into RELESE.

267,02e9bce,- CRDWriter added (denniej0) - fixed a bug in PrimitivePDBWriter: would only work if run from a base AtomGroup  not a derived   class such as a segment - updated CHANGELOG and TODO,1538148823.7699132,1
268,1433d0a,added test case for DCDWriter unitcell fix (and updated CHANGELOG),1538148818.038485,1

The default is now True to   get the behaviour from previous version of MDAnalysis.   Note: I'm not sure if the AROUND selection is working properly at         all. It didn't work for me before and it needs to be tested         again.,1538149403.28706,0
1190,309970.0,additional tests for coordinate readers - more GRO tests  coordinates and distances fail at the moment because the GRO reader   does not convert units (TO BE FIXED) - more tests for PDB files - use GRO parser for the XTC and TRR tests instead of PDB (a bit faster and more native),1538149358.245889,0
1191,52728c8,make AtomGroup.coordinates() return an array of type numpy.float32 by default - distance array needs float32 and when interfacing with I/O this is also   how coordinates are stored so it makes sense to enforce it at this   crucial entry point - LeafletFinder would raise an error when building the adjacency matrix   because the array returned by coordinates() was float64,1538149332.854685,0

2268,24827d9,unittests: new tests for distance_array() and self_distance_array() - added distance array tests  including known failures with copy=False - classified the XTC/TRR tests as slow - updated docs on testing considerably - moved filenames needed for all unittests into separate module NOTE: test target values were obtaine on my Macbook running python 2.6  OS X 10.6.3  this version of MDAnalysis  the should probably be checked against independent evidence such as VMD measure().,0.0,0
2269,b53c031,Added bfactors property to the AtomGroup. It is only set when the structure is loaded from a PDB file.

2270,6ba94a7,libxdr: added function to count the number of frames in a trajectory - read_xtc_numframes() and read_trr_numframes() do the brain-damaged thing and   iterate through all frames  in particular for trr one should be able to do better - maybe cache the frame offsets and in this way implement random access (LOOS seems to be doing   something like this) - added a few simple test cases,0.0,0

This works well       but keep in mind that this obtains the docs from imported modules  works best       with developer installation (i.e. ""python setup.py develop"") - ""make html"" works fine for me",0.0,0
