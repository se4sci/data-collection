349,538e613,small compatibility enhancements: - explicitly assigning values to the FEFamily entries helps in   identifying the family  whether a .dat file was produced with or   without enabled ifem - for the EquationSystems<T> I/O it actually does not matter   what System type it handles  and what system type it loads.   So  changed the error (in case of system type mismatch) to a simple std::out - added in FrequencySystem the EquationSystems::parameter n_frequencies,1

367,7bf90a7,Bugfixes: backup the solution  and don't overwrite the accumulated error values,1
368,0f7d15d,Added Jacobi quadrature rules. These rules allow for conical product quadrature to be performed on tris and tets.  Although these types of rules are non-optimal (use more points than necessary and cluster points) they are correct  and easy to construct for high orders.  At this time  if you select anything beyond fifth-order quadrature for tets or tris you will get a conical product Gauss-Jacobi rule.  Other changes include fixing a broken 7 point Gauss quadrature rule which had the wrong weights  and making a few functions in the QBase class virtual instead of pure virtual.  This way you can create concrete quadrature classes without implementing anything for 2 and 3D.  The init_1D function is still pure virtual so you will at least need to define 1D quadrature rules if you create a new class.,1

388,1e8674d,"Committing patch from Lorenzo Botti which fixes and improves XYZ finite elements. From his email: ""The major change is related to a scaling introduced to improve the condition number on small and big elements (small and big compared to the reference element). With such a scaling on linear hexs the XYZ is equivalent to a MONOMIAL basis  independently of the element size. On curved elements the approximation properties of this scaled XYZ should be better than MONOMIAL and should allow to go up to a third or fourth degree approximation without any trouble."" Also added miscellaneous_ex8 which is a copy of misellaneous_ex5  but uses XYZ elements instead of MONOMIAL elements. Tested successfully in 2D and 3D.",1

This also enables   to choose whether one wants to convert quad4->quad8 or quad4->quad9   through a simple bool option in MeshBase::all_second_order(bool) - reduced repeated code in adjacent_vertices through moving these short   int matrices to Hex  Quad  Prism etc - fixed GMV support for higher-order Prisms (enuff debugging for today...  -),1

May not be really necessary    but want to be on the safe side: who knows what the default   constructor of std::complex does with only one double passed in. - added container class FEComputeData.  Serves as a hide for   I/O to customized FE classes.  E.g. for the notorious infinite   elements  the compute_data()  using FEComputeData  is the physically   correct counterpart to shape(),1

1376,dbb4754,rbOOmit change: There was a bug for complex-values in RBConstruction::enrich_RB_space which meant that basis functions were not orthogonal.

1475,4326048,Added a new option to the build_cube and build_square mesh generation routines which builds meshes graded into the boundary layers.

1491,1c322e7,Changed default behavior of the basic_elem_iterator to return true if the Elem* is not NULL.  Added typedefs for predicated iterators into arrays of Elem*.  Added accessor functions to elem.h to return the begin and end of the neighbors array.  This may be useful when iterating over neighbors and deciding which ones are (are not) on the boundary.,0
1492,7c1b199,Let's not deprecate Parallel::wait - the vector-of-requests case doesn't really have a new equally-convenient equivalent  and so we might as well leave the single request case in too for symmetry.,0
1493,c9b9e8d,Printing DoFs is useful for debugging.,0
1494,e6945d3,Add MeshBase::query_{elem node_ptr} methods.  Now element and node accessor behavior is implementation independent: elem/node_ptr assert that the requested element exists  query_elem/node_ptr simply return NULL if it doesn't.,0

1520,979a890,MessageTag::invalid_tag.  Set this to INT_MIN.  Note that we can't use std::numeric_limits<int>::min() (which is equivalent) because that is a function call and not allowed in the initialization of static data in this case.,0

1535,670efee,improved compatibility with infinite elements.  Sorry John  when i added the if-test  i did not think that conventional FE may still need it. Right now  i think this is something we both can live with  -),0
1536,23e1f9d,rbOOmit change: If a CouplingMatrix is attached to an RBConstruction then we should only increment the designated blocks in matrix assembly  otherwise matrix assembly is extremely slow since we go outside the sparsity pattern.,0
1537,e620507,More assertions.  Yes  I wrote user code that would have tripped one of these.  No  I'm not proud.,0

1542,e15c566,Adding PetscDiffSolver class (which still has runtime bugs),0
1543,67ae721,Added a non-const const_elements_begin() function to the MeshBase class.  The reasoning behind this is you may want to enforce const iteration over the elements of a non-const Mesh.  Changed a few places in the code to use this new function.,0
1544,07726ce,std::abs() already does the right thing for floats.,0
1545,966da2f,Modifying an original mesh Elem (rather than making and modifying a copy) for ALE is an ugly non-const-correct non-thread-safe hack.  We can at least correct the API for now  and get to the implementation later.,0

1549,4774bc5,"Restore ""non-coarsenable elements flagged with -1"" behavior to create_parent_error_vector implementation",0
1550,28297b7,Fixed mainly documentation typos.  Also decided that  although BoundaryInfo::sync() can technically be made const  it is not strictly a const function since it *does modify* the mesh which contains it. Specifically  it sets the subdomain_id for some elements on the boundary. The result is that write_diva() back to non-const for now.,0

1554,3ab8711,rbOOmit change: Further improvements to the rbOOmit API  related to separation of Construction and Evaluation stages. We now only call RBSystem::initialize_RB_system if we need to do truth-dependent calculations  for Online (evaluation) calculations  we do not need RBSystem::initialize_RB_system  we just use an RBEvaluation instead.,0

1573,f6597a2,* Ben once said  EquationSystems should take care of time stepping.   so i changed ex8 to make use of the EquationSystems features (flag    param) * added two macros that keep instantiation data in (almost) one place    for the two templated classes EquationSystems<> and FE<>.

1579,59838d9,rbOOmit change: added boolean flag exit_greedy_on_repeated_parameters to quit the greedy when we encounter the same parameters twice in a row (in some cases this indicates saturation of the error bound due to rounding error). Also  cleaned up some whitespace.,0

Tested on linux and hp-ux - added typedefs MeshData::const_node_data_iterator and   MeshData::const_node_data_iterator similar to the iterators for   the elements and nodes in MeshBase.  Convenient when one wants to   iterate directly over the nodes/elements with associated data  e.g.   Dirichlet-type boundary conditions.  Tested on linux and hp-ux,0

1822,7fe8025,"Extend the MeshTools::Generation::build_sphere() function to optionally build what is called an ""icosasphere"" (or  more rarely  ""icosphere""). That is  a regularly triangulated 2D spherical mesh  obtained by iterative refinement of a regular icosahedron. The patch fits quite nicely into the preexisting code. An icosasphere can be built by setting the new flag ""flat"" to false (default true) when building a 2D mesh in 3D space.",0
1823,00a97e8,BoundingBox intersections and unions,0
1824,2a63e8c,Added boundary integration support for infinite elements.,0
1825,20a04b8,After the element repartitioning on a distributed mesh  each processor doesn't yet know about all it's own new elements. Partiitoner::set_node_processor_ids() was not written to handle such a case.  We could rewrite it  but for now it seems simpler to just do a redistribute() (if applicable - making it a MeshBase virtual decides that) immediately after element repartitioning.  redistribute() and gather_neighboring_elements() don't depend on node processor_ids being correct yet.,0
1826,602f07d,Moved the build_inf_elem functionality to a separate class of its own.  Now if you want to build infinite elements on top of your mesh  you must construct a InfElemBuilder object  and call the same functionality as before.  See ex6 for details.,0

1847,b95827f,fixed missing return warning,0
1848,b24115f,moved the hanging node condtraint computation out of dof_map into the individual FE types.  This allows each FE type to implement its own constraint calculation  and the DofMap does not need to know anything about it.,0
1849,7788809,added the XYZ finite element type.  This is similar to the monomials  except the shape functions are defined in terms of physical coordinates.  This requires a slightly different approach for reinitialization  so the class has some additional specialization.  The FEBase/FE relationship is growing complex  however  and will likely change in the future.,0
1850,a575f37,Reduced Basis change: Removed singe_matrix_mode. The purpose of this mode was to provide a low-memory version  which re-assembled matrices rather than storing them. But it wasn't used and therefore wasn't well tested  and it complicated the code for little benefit. If this functionality is desired in the future  better to put it in a subclass.,0

There are still several lingering design issues which will have to be addressed when additional Mesh subclasses are actually created.  MeshBase now contains a great deal of pure virtual functions which have to be reimplemented in derived classes.  I am certain not all of them will make sense for every subclass  so we will probably end up with another level of abstraction like UnstructuredMesh and then the actual Mesh class.  For now some additional clean-up is probably required  but the examples are running correctly.  I haven't compiled with enable-everything  but if you find something I will try to fix it.,0

2021,3700fac,Tried to remove a lot of unnecessary header files. For some reason math.h was included in many places but as far as I can tell you only need it for sqrt  fabs  and maybe pow.  If that is not the case  I can fix it.  Also started commenting the reason for inclusion of standard header files  e.g. #include <algorithm> // for std::sort and the like.  Not including C++ header files speeds up compilation times a bit.,0

2023,56d6720,Added neighbor norm calculations to verify_jacobians. Also added code to constrain neighbor residuals and jacobians (this code may be incorrect  it definitely needs to be double-checked). It appears that the numeric jacobian is not calculation elem-neighbor cross terms. Need to fix this.,0

But use PointLocatorList with CAUTION!  since this is primarily intended for locating the closest element  where the point may live in 3D  and the element  too  but the element is actually 2D (surface).  When applied to volumetric meshes (which is not truly intended)  it may happen that the centroid of an adjacent element is closer due to extremely distorted elements,0

It differs from normal iterators in that op++ automatically advances the iterator to the next item in the container which satisfies the user-supplied predicate.  From the abstract PredicatedIterator base class  several concrete classes have already been defined.  They are currently used in the MeshBase class to iterate over the _elements vector.

5983,e3e5ea5,Removed a stray code fragment.,0
5984,55c9c73,Some changes for complex number support. libMesh now compiles with --enable-complex  but I still have to check ExactSolution for complex numbers a little more carefully.,0

5986,daa58e7,added optimizations for computing edge data in the case of XYZ finite elements,0
5987,0efbaea,The partitioners now set a new variable in the Mesh called _n_parts.  This variable was needed since n_subdomains does not map directly to the number of partitions created when using partitioners  and neither does n_processors() since you may partition a mesh on one processor if you wish.  Therefore the partitioners all set the new variable _n_parts in the mesh to allow for this possibility.  The GMV routine now allows you to plot (without error messages) the different partitions of the grid.,0

5990,e3a6962,Created a MatlabIO object to handle reading meshes generated in the pdetool program  and removed the previous read_matlab() routines from the MeshBase class.  Also removed the generic read() and write() routines from the MeshBase class since they were not being used and consisted of error messages only.,0
5991,780a9c2,Added an OFFIO class for reading standard OFF OOGL format.  Removed corresponding functions from the MeshBase interface.,0
5992,321ad52,Added the ShaneeIO class for reading old school shanee meshes from the precursor of libmesh.  Removed corresponding functions from MeshBase and removed the file mesh_misc_support.C,0

6001,3b5cc78,Added operator << functions to all the classes which had print_info() members.  Now you can do: Mesh mesh(2)  std::cout << mesh << std::endl  That is equivalent to: Mesh mesh(2)  mesh.print_info() ,0
6002,2b0278e,Added support for some methods of TetGen 1.3 library. To make use of the functionality added  the environment variable TETGEN_DIR must be defined and libMesh must be configured with option --enable-tetgen. Note that the support is for version 1.3 which should be available soon. Also added ASCII output for medit file viewer (www-rocq1.inria.fr/gamma/medit).,0

6042,f58c8a8,Changed error message to print the entire thing to std::cerr,0
6043,0a062b8,Added additional constructor for building PetscMatrix objects from existing PETSc Mats  also added the _get_submatrix() routine which uses PETScs MatGetSubMatrix() function to extract submatrices.,0
6044,c47015e,Generalized the PetscInterface solve member  to allow it to take different matrices for the system matrix and the preconditioner.  Does not affect existing code.,0
6045,e601d54,Added matlab printing capabilities (for PetscVectors) in the NumericVector class.  Also the create_subvector routine was added.,0
6046,8a93dfb,Working on removing unnecessary #includes to reduce compilation dependency..,0
6047,85d47b0,moved all gmv support into GMVIO  added proper coupling between discontinuous basis functions in the DOF map.  Note that this will over-allocate memory for the Q2P-1 LBB stable element which has no inter-element coupling for the discontinuous pressure,0
6048,8a03a6d,Adjustments to TetGen 1.3 release.,0
6049,4458578,Added a virtual destructor.,0
6050,ccf40ad,GCC 3.4.1 complained that almost all the variables from the FEBase class which are used in this file were undefined.  Adding this-> seemed to clear up the problem  which did not exist for any other files.,0
6051,7bf9640,Changed ex4 to allow the setting of the problem size on the command line.,0
6052,7f45f5a,Added option for non-glx gmv.,0
6053,244d5f7,Preliminary support (2D only  read only) for GMSH file format added.,0
6054,4859f74,Reworked the tecplot_connectivity() and vtk_connectivity() functionality in the Elem class and all subclasses.  They have been combined into one function called connectivity() which should be extensible for new IO packages such as GMSH and DB Explorer without changing the interface of the Elem class. Sorry for the wicked recompile.,0
6055,60b8fdf,Added enumeration file for IO software packages like Tecplot  GMV  etc.,0
6056,a69c50d,More changes for the connectivity routines in the Elem class. Now there are no longer separate functions for write_ucd_connectivity and write_tecplot_connectivity. They have been combined in the more generic write_connectivity routine.,0
6057,21befbf,Minor changes to documentation only.,0
6058,0f51ebb,Needed read access to some derivatives.,0
6059,057e458,Added some additional documentation to the solve member.,0
6060,894414d,replaced find with std::find  added #include <algorithm>.  How has that not been caught before?,0
6061,12964cd,This commit was manufactured by cvs2svn to create tag 'libmesh-0_4_3-rc1'.,0
6062,521380d,Changed the tegen configuration slightly to be like the rest of the libraries in aclocal.m4.  Also removed dependency on stdio.h.,0
6063,f76bd6a,Removing unnecessary includes of <stdio.h> as well as documenting why it is necessary in cases where it is.,0
6064,82bd273,Improving the binary functionality for GMV so that it is more portable and less ugly.,0
6065,0d41218,Apparently it was possible to remove the <iostream> inclusion from libmesh_common.h.  This should result in a little less unnecessary inclusions of the standard header files.,0
6066,400fe5c,Added #include <assert.h> in several places where it was originally not needed since <stdlib.h> was already included.  Library compiles under AIX 5.2.0.0.,0
6067,6d1d50e,Updated the .depend file for the library.,0
6068,303663f,added the script create_libmesh_release to facilitate creating & tagging CVS snapshots for release,0
6069,2c00626,added #include <assert.h> to libmesh_common.h  removed it from others,0
6070,0facff4,Added new USER_PRECOND type,0
6071,ebcef0b,cleaned up the trees a bit and added an option to create a tree from the elements directly  bypassing the nodes.  The obvious extension (that I have not made yet) will use the trees (and PointLocators) to find not only elements but also nodes.  Incidentally  the motivation for this was reading a structured surface mesh with a singular axis that contained a number of points at the same physical location in space.  When the target bin size for the tree was less than the number of coincident points an infinite loop was created...  Charming.,0
6072,0cb82fa,Made a few methods in MeshCommunication const and introduced the first use of the mutable keyword in the library to allow the operator() method of the point_locator_* classes to be const. If mutable causes a difficulty for your compiler  please let me know and I will undo the change!,0
6073,d2f42e7,removed stray here()s,0
6074,4e4029a,added GMVIO  changed all the examples to use it.  Still need to roll in write_discontinuous_gmv,0
6075,4f1d850,Added clear_riesz_representors() to RBEvaluation to clear the Riesz representor vectors used in computing the residual in the RB method. This can allow us to save memory when we train many bases.,0
6076,e0e5e4c,rbOOmit change: Moved Fq_representor_norms from RBEvaluation into RBSystem  since they are not basis dependent,0
6077,582a57b,add callback for extra send_list entries,0
6078,7ca0720,cleanup refinement flags on init and read,0
6079,e1b893b,rbOOmit change: Changed DerivedRBEvaluation so that clear resets residual_type_flag to RESIDUAL_WRT_UBER. This can be important in hp calculations  for example.,0
6080,1da8fb6,Use LibMeshInit,0
6081,a039a2a,System::print_info now outputs some DofMap information about sparsity and constraints,0
6082,ae0f470,rbOOmit change: added resize_RB_data in RBEvaluation  which clears and resizes all the data that depends on the reduced basis space. This allows us to change the amount of data a given RBEvaluation can hold.,0
6083,2e4be07,If we read system data from a file that has fewer variables than our current system  let's remap that data onto our own variables of the same name.  This enables physics-upgrading restarts.,0
6084,23ff717,Major rbOOmit revision: removed the function-pointer based assembly and replaced it with object-based assembly via RBTheta and ElemAssembly. This approach is much more flexible. Made corresponding changes in ex23.,0
6085,6bde4db,Nemesis reader now reads sidesets.,0
6086,eb2b119,Don't call ex_get_side_set unless there are sidesets to get  otherwise Exodus prints an annoying warning.,0
6087,46a0746,Need to also read and write header information in order to do correct basis function IO in RBEvaluation.,0
6088,01fa209,Nemesis now reads nodesets.,0
6089,4c648c4,Only check for PETSC_ARCH (and disable PETSc if not present) in PETSc 2.x builds.,0
6090,ec5cca0,Increment reference counter if the copy constructor is called,0
6091,cc162e2,Call base class copy constructor  otherwise compiler warns in dbg mode...,0
6092,0e3bc0a,"Exodus files also call Quad4's ""quad4"" in addition to QUAD  QUAD4  and quad.",0
6093,ec81c50,Made the compile line more modular.,0
6094,95a2a09,Nemesis no longer trusts the input file to tell it the mesh dimension... instead it determines that from the dimensions of all the elements it actually reads in.,0
6095,83a87df,avoid cast warning on gcc-4.1,0
6096,dff2f9e,We need to call is_child_on_side() from the parent for it to be correct on tets  due to the diagonal selection trick.,0
6097,c9a868e,Use the correct configure result for xz support,0
6098,bf81bbe,Better (and race-condition-free when two apps read the same zipped file at once...) xz/bzip2 support,0
6099,7e2e6ca,Tagging 0.7.1-rc1,0
6100,4d0879d,Cleaned up the code for clearing RB systems. It can mostly now be done by clearing the associated RBEvaluation object  do not need the complicated clear_basis_dependent_data etc any more.,0
6101,7cd6c0e,rbOOmit change: Pulled the basis dependent Riesz representors out of RBSystem and subclasses  and moved them into RBEvaluation and subclasses.,0
6102,9b553c3,Added Parallel::barrier() to synchronize before creating an Xdr object to avoid errors in parallel.,0
6103,e10d35a,string.h needed for strcmp  strncmp  strlen  strncpy,0
6104,5d3d53e,Modified the write_offline_data_to_files and read_offline_data_from_files methods in rbOOmit. They now take an extra argument (with default value ALL_DATA) that indicates whether we should write out all the data  or just the basis function (in)dependent subset. Also  the greedy_params vector has been moved from RBSystem to RBEvaluation since each basis is generated with a different set of greedy parameters in general.,0
6105,97fdefa,Separators in ASCII Xdr::data(vector) output,0
6106,ae83615,Semicolons are our friends.,0
6107,403dac9,Added add_vector_transpose to NumericVector  which computes A^T * v,0
6108,65beeb5,Made attach_output virtual in RBSystem.,0
6109,33965a5,Forward Partitioner declaration was causing some compiler warnings,0
6110,9ec6f96,Added a short-circuit for RBSystem::compute_output_dual_norms when we don't have any outputs,0
6111,0297e9f,object-based assembly etc...,0
6112,8b562b7,Use standard C++ string conversion and parsing instead of the sort-of-standard C functions that were giving Cygwin trouble,0
6113,5a54840,support for object-based QOI functions and derivatives,0
6114,38d9796,still need stdarg.h for variable-length arguments,0
6115,7750ef6,Changed default output data format for RB output vectors  they are now written to a single file outputs.dat by default  rather than to multiple files. The boolean multiple_files_for_outputs in RBEvaluation controls whether we write to a single file or multiple files.,0
6116,fd15305,MeshData is now libmesh_deprecated(),0
6117,bfcfd77,Do parallel_only verification on libMeshInit,0
6118,dece5d1,Revert to strtok_r for now,0
6119,bb601ea,An fopen failure isn't an internal problem to assert away  it's something to always test and potentially throw a file error exception for.,0
6120,059e3ac,setting CC_TRY_LIST and then overwriting it is not a good idea...,0
6121,2b7e018,Replaced usage of strtok_r with std::string operations.  strtok_r is deprecated on some systems and is not available on some flavors of Cygwin.,0
6122,2a8e2de,include <time.h>  this error was discovered on cygwin.,0
6123,48ab641,Some small changes to the RB classes. In particular  made residual_scaling_denom return alpha_LB rather than sqrt alpha_LB  since that is the appropriate default for a coercive problem.,0
6124,1a5ae00,Remember to read comments off of the end of vector<complex> data,0
6125,3f10167,Detect Intel v12 compilers,0
6126,53a64c4,Changed add_new_rb_evaluation_object so that it returns a pointer to the newly added RBEvaluation object.,0
6127,8bc3d84,Disable example VTKIO(ParallelMesh) output until we can get that working,0
6128,1a40b4e,Left pad filenames with zeroes to match nemesis behavior.,0
6129,d62bf67,Changes log from 0.7.0->0.7.1,0
6130,3c955a0,Changed plotting from GMV to ExodusII.,0
6131,df95f14,it is not sufficient to check for the existance of rpc/rpc.h and then infer XDR support.  We now check for the availability of xdrsdtio_create  which should be sufficient.,0
6132,8a84a1e,Added a cholesky factorization routine to the DenseMatrix class. For SPD matrices  Cholesky factorization is supposed to be faster than straight LU.,0
6133,2d3a7d9,changes from the laptop I forgot to check in...,0
6134,96486e5,Made the A(i i) > 0 check in _cholesky_decompose ifdef to build the library when option complex is enabled. Take care when using this with complex numbers.,0
6135,5740992,Changed two lines which made and returned a std::pair to instead use std::make_pair.,0
6136,b6f7791,fixed a typo in a comment :-),0
6137,057016c,OK  now elements and nodes get numbered in a rational way when there was no mesh refinement.  This will correspond to their original position in these vectors  without messing with any trimming,0

6140,4816e20,added a rhs to the ExplicitSystem,0
6141,e94d9e0,moved rhs from the ImplicitSystem to the ExplicitSystem  now the ImplicitSystem is derived from the ExplicitSystem,0
6142,a5e5078,modified xdrIO to accept id and title strings longer than 80 characters,0
6143,0b677c4,forgot this...,0
6144,a1d1750,changed all PETSc CHKERRQ calls to CHKERRABORT.  This solves the problem of returning from void functions.  CHKERRABORT also calls MPI_Abort after printing a diagnostic error.  Consequently  all PETSc errors are treated as fatal.  This was the original intent  but CHKERRQ was the only documented function  so that is what I used.,0
6145,60ed03d,added optimize flags for Sun C++,0
6146,950b40e,upgraded Metis and ParMetis to v3.1  which was released in August 2003.,0
6147,d1e7ded,added Sun compiler to supported list,0
6148,ac84756,Removed some unnecessary headers and used std::make_pair instead of building a pair and returning it in two separate lines.,0
6149,232d129,Changed dynamic casts of references to be dynamic casts to pointers.  This allows simple error checking by comparing the resulting pointer against NULL.  When casting references fails  a std::bad_cast exception is thrown  however  all exceptions are in general ignored by the library.,0
6150,522b527,Changed several of the MeshBase::write_* and Mesh::write_* methods to be const.  Having some difficulty with the xdr and unv formats since they are implemented in terms of the FooInterface objects which expect to be able to read OR write.  Thinking about whether or not its worth messing with.,0
6151,0e5fc6f,Made the write_diva methods const by changing BoundaryInfo::sync() to a const method.,0
6152,5c4b2ea,Minor cosmetic changes to the predicated_iterator class.,0
6153,9072a20,added the MeshIO class to encapsulate mesh/soln read/write operations and get them out of the Mesh class.  I have already converted UNV  UCD  and Tecplot I/O to this new format and will continue with others incrimentally.  All should feel free to convert any existing format they might want to...,0
6154,beb6141,removed cvshtml,0
6155,ee4ec5f,Ported the Diva writing code to the new MeshIO format.  Does this even work anymore?  I bet she has long since changed her format!.,0
6156,5adf203,Added Daniel's and my project pages to the applications.,0
6157,a4f4b9f,Tagging libMesh 0.7.1 (hopefully final),0
6158,6b8356e,Revert accidental turning on of verbose mode in Nemesis_IO.,0
6159,9525ee6,Adding Elem::replace_child  to make ParallelMesh modification code easier,0

6163,d2ac2c2,allow for turning off partitioning,0
6164,6.421e+54,We want to use LIBMESH_OPTIONS everywhere - start_in_debugger is nice...,0
6165,16dd5e2,Some more flexible quiet/verbose options for DiffSolver,0
6166,88914de,remove debug printing,0
6167,d379d19,actually implement BoundingBox::intersect(),0
6168,657f732,Don't call redistribute  etc. if this is actually a serial mesh but libmesh was configured with --enable-parmesh.,0
6169,92f5e64,Handle repartitioning of fewer-elements-than-processors non-serial meshes,0
6170,d6c1f84,Don't catch exceptions in ex26/ex27  we don't expect convergence failures but we do expect possible logic bugs when developing,0
6171,60053b0,Partitioner::partition is parallel_only(),0
6172,3a490e4,Restoring (deprecated) point_locator() for backwards compatibility  new thread safe function is now sub_point_locator(),0
6173,aae76ee,prepare_for_use() is parallel_only,0
6174,3867ee6,Update libmesh_example_asserts for PETSc-only code,0
6175,75b9641,TypeVector with LIBMESH_DIM < 3 no longer mollycoddles weak code.,0
6176,908c9f7,Many library changes to optimize  and conform to new stricter --enable-2D-only TypeVector behavior,0
6177,405c172,"Make ex1 -o option more robust  actually test it in ""make run"".",0
6178,66ea92c,add BoundingBox::contains_point... taking into account Roy's changes to intersect,0
6179,ad7944e,Cleaned up and clarified a few comments,0
6180,a540f5b,Add some comments to remind us about a thread safety gotcha when we multithread these loops,0
6181,f803303,We can't always link examples until the library's been built,0
6182,711c299,Efficiency improvements (and a few const-correctness improvements) for periodic boundaries code,0
6183,148bcd2,A slightly lower tolerance still gives good default results,0
6184,d8dbdef,Made op() code backward compatible for PETSc 2.1.X versions.,0
6185,d97ee7b,replaced std::endl with \n in all file IO and stringstreams.  std::endl forces a flush  which kills performance on some machines,0
6186,2319686.0,Turn down the analytic Jacobian tolerances so they don't fail on single-precision tests,0
6187,23d122d,Added warning about not using laspack with ex8.,0
6188,93a15bf,Added new FE shape functions based on Bernstein polynomials. Similarly to the szabab elements the Bernstein shapes should only be available if higher order shapes are enabled.,0
6189,74cf922,accidently comitted unnecessary changes in ex16.,0
6190,3272fa6,Added dofs_on_edge function  FEInterface:: to dofs_on{side edge},0
6191,6fd425c,moved some functions to MeshTool  reimplemented some stuff using the new iterators,0
6192,286ff7d,added *.dot,0
6193,c79f382,cannot hard-code -lstdc++  that is a gcc-specific lib.  Use ANSI prototypes in triangle to avoid warnings with icc v8.1 on the altix,0
6194,c0eb4c0,Added SideEdge proxy class,0
6195,12664ce,Added Elem::build_edge(),0
6196,8a452b3,Added edge_reinit and supporting functions,0
6197,19c0f85,allow for a user-defined MPI communicator instead of MPI_COMM_WORLD.  This allows libMesh to be run on a subset of processors inside a larger MPI job.  As a general rule a library should never use MPI_COMM_WORLD,0
6198,eed0e87,Added tetgen 1.3.3 to the contrib directory. Also merged the different TeGenWrapper levels.,0
6199,fbd5d27,Updating the configuration process.  Note that these changes should not have affected the current libmesh_config.h file yet  the plan is to slowly build up the libmesh_config_contrib.h file until it is ready to configure for all the contributed software  and then remove the contributed pound-defines from libmesh_config.h,0
6200,7e8c3f8,Added Elem::is_child_on_{edge side}() functions  Changed Mesh::find_neighbors to find subactive neighbors too (which are now used in is_child_on_side),0
6201,8659874,Perform linking of dyn. lib. step with C++ compiler.  Not sure if this makes any difference  though.,0
6202,7bad4fc,Oops  re-added a comment,0
6203,4b0282f,Perform dynamic linking step with C++ compiler.,0
6204,9228865,Added -lz to link line.  This may be needed on some Macs?,0
6205,d2fe101,adding MeshCommunication::distribute(),0
6206,acaf76a,removed deprecated PetscSetCommWorld,0
6207,c1d885d,removed deprecated PetscSetCommWorld,0

6212,3aa9782,Ups  some more changes for complex.,0
6213,50a28ed,Removed inactive devs from photo page.,0
6214,d7b9585,Added Roy to the developers page.,0
6215,6315ad8,added virtual destructors where necessary in TetGenInterface,0
6216,f9affda,Oops  would help if there was a Makefile.,0
6217,ce6ed4e,updated Gmsh support from Martin.,0
6218,619a702,Removed extraneous print statement.,0
6219,8e4bf25,Changes for complex.,0
6220,440e5a9,Changed ExactSolution to consider the EquationSystems parameters instead of just the time.,0
6221,d63a7cb,Meshtool now Conforms to new StatisticsVector interface.,0
6222,436818b,Tried to reduce extensive use of friend classes in MeshData. Also modified example 7 which now uses an l-shaped mesh and corresponding mesh data.,0
6223,9d540c5,No need to project on unchanged elements,0
6224,222ff19,initial support for the pseudo-ExodusII files written by gridgen,0
6225,fdc70ee,trivial change  updated const iterators now that non-const to const conversion works,0
6226,57e8ee3,Added triangle to the contrib directory and the libmesh build system. Added initial header and source files to be expanded upon later.  We should probably distribute tetgen as well since it is only 1 file.,0
6227,b55fcf8,Oops  forgot to commit header file.,0
6228,00d0bc0,Added routine to delaunay triangulate a square.,0
6229,3276f53,moved MeshBase::contract() up to Mesh.  Unfortunately  there is no good way to make MeshBase::delete_elem() efficient  so the old implementation of MeshBase::contract() was (potentially) O(n_elem^2)  and consumed approximately 20 percent of the runtime in ex10.  This new implementation exploits the fact that the elements are stored in a vector (which is why it was moved up to the Mesh class) and is linear in the number of elements.  The new implementation is less that 1 percent of the run time in ex10.,0
6230,22326a6,Finally implemented the EigenSystem and an interface to the SLEPc eigen solvers. Also include an example ex16 to show how to use the new feature. SLEPc support makes only sense in combination with the corresponding PETSc version. Hence cofigure checks if both PETSc and SLEPc have the same version numbers. The Interface may only work for the latest SLEPc currently available (2.2.1).,0
6231,dd00afa,Changed the name of the gmv output files to enable AutoRead.,0
6232,7e02419,"After contracting an element it is no longer ""just coarsened""",0
6233,a1aeb88,Added FEContinuity enum  Added FEBase::get_continuity() for reporting it  Merged C0 and C1_constraints into proj_constraints using it.,0
6234,e87e589,added PETSc 2.3.x support,0
6235,87f9cfe,Added default case to prevent unhandled cases warning.,0
6236,7d8b7f4,Added Elem::is_node_on_edge,0
6237,e51ffca,OS X support,0
6238,18b83aa,added standard header,0
6239,c448247,OS X Compatibility,0
6240,ab63dc8,added FE<>::get_continuity() to fe_macro.h.  Changed debug compile flags to use -O0 with gcc  this provides a noticeable speedup in compile time under gcc4.  The resulting code  however  is noticeably slower.,0
6241,0642fda,Make eliminate_unrefined_patches prevent the future creation (via coarsening) of new unrefined patches  and add tests to *{refine coarsen}_elements to make sure compatibility conditions are now satisfied after refinement or coarsening is done.,0
6242,db39d47,Don't try to compute_constraints() for non-active elements!,0
6243,4e75ad1,The print() function is now generalized to take an arbitrary stream instead of just std::cout by default.,0
6244,0086c99,renumber the elements in Mesh::contract(),0
6245,b2c3ce2,Added includes according to changes in class system.,0
6246,8ae5cde,Forward declare Mesh and Elem in equation_systems.h instead of #include. This greatly reduced header file inter-dependencies.  Also added the new deprecated() macro for marking code which will be removed in future versions  and deprecated some redundant parts of the EquationSystems interface.  As a result of removing the #include  most of the examples had to have elem.h #included directly.,0
6247,6e6cc51,Initialize devel-mode variable.,0
6248,9caf533,Adding missing header.,0
6249,2890f58,Removed deprecated EquationSystems call.,0

6255,171f578,This commit was manufactured by cvs2svn to create tag 'libmesh-0_5_0-rc2'.,0
6256,77709d7,Changed gnuplot_io.C to use a std::map to form the data files. Also  made data filename depend on gnuplot script filename so that in time-dependent problems data won't be overwritten.,0
6257,fa0a998,Changes for complex.,0
6258,9487f20,This commit was manufactured by cvs2svn to create tag 'libmesh-0_5_0-rc3'.,0

6269,cbe92bc,Stopped compilation of target printing to screen,0
6270,d4b0069,Oops  do not delete _dof_map in clear()  only in dtor!,0

6280,d9c70c1,Reducing dependencies: sparse_matrix.h no longer includes dof_map.h,0
6281,73f8f01,Reducing dependencies.  Print functions are generally not fast anyway  inlining them leads to unnecessary dependencies and larger headers.  Removing print functions from headers.,0

6296,23b73fa,added *_devel,0
6297,82ab3b2,Reducing compiler dependencies: Changed several includes to forward declarations in dof_map.h.  This typically involves turning class member objects into class members which are pointers to objects.

6303,10c9bfd,Updated the examples.,0
6304,c822b79,Moved the ExodusII and XDR I/O implementation into ExodusII_IO and XdrIO  respectively.  These classes conform to the MeshIO<> interface.  All the I/O implementation should now be separated out of the Mesh/MeshBase classes.,0
6305,4a62b8f,libMesh now works with gcc 4.0 (latest CVS),0
6306,9543707,Also reset number of partitions to zero upon call to mesh.clear().,0
6307,c089c62,Removed elem.h dependency from mesh_base.h by making the delete_elem function not inline. Now we can get away with forward declaration.,0
6308,a1c70ad,Forgot one place where #include elem.h was needed.,0

6739,5c6ebad,PetscMatrix::print_personal now prints to file when requested (rather than just cout).  The implementation is not particularly efficient (since print_personal gets passed an ostream) but it does work.  And how efficient do you need to be if you are printing out matrices anyway?,0

8329,3b70312,Reducing header file dependences.  Instead of having a BoundaryInfo object in the MeshBase  we now have an AutoPtr<BoundaryInfo>.  This maintains the same level of safety with regard to garbage collection and removes the boundary_info.h dependency from mesh_base.h. If you have any code which used the mesh.boundary_info.xxx() syntax  you will have to change it to mesh.boundary_info->xxx().  The same idea was used in system.h to hold an AutoPtr<DofMap> rather than a naked pointer.,0
