5,5,0f7d15d,2003-02-06 06:02:42,Added Jacobi quadrature rules. These rules allow for conical product quadrature to be performed on tris and tets.  Although these types of rules are non-optimal (use more points than necessary and cluster points) they are correct  and easy to construct for high orders.  At this time  if you select anything beyond fifth-order quadrature for tets or tris you will get a conical product Gauss-Jacobi rule.  Other changes include fixing a broken 7 point Gauss quadrature rule which had the wrong weights  and making a few functions in the QBase class virtual instead of pure virtual.  This way you can create concrete quadrature classes without implementing anything for 2 and 3D.  The init_1D function is still pure virtual so you will at least need to define 1D quadrature rules if you create a new class.,1

337,31,def48f1,2003-07-22 19:14:45,Moved a templated inlined function out of the C file and into the h file.  Funny to note that this compiled on gcc but not on xlC.  The main problem I think is the instantiation of templated *functions* as opposed to classes.  xlC wouldnt instantiate them correctly unless they were in the header file.,1
338,32,52d2d6a,2003-07-23 21:32:27,When checking the state of an ifstream  it is not correct to simply check if its !bad().  This is because the bad bit is not set when the file does not exist.  Instead the failbit is set.  Therefore it is more correct to check if the stream is good() e.g. assert(in.good()) rather than !bad().,0

353,47,7dda254,2003-08-08 14:11:27,- extended the MeshData to compatible mode: when the  MeshData   was not active at mesh import time  one can still write   a Universal mesh  or read/write mesh data through the   compatibility mode.

Reduced   mem requirements for the adjacent_vertices matrices of all higher-order   elements through converting to short int - reduced # of virtual fn's in Elem by one: the higher_order_equiv_elem()   or so got moved into a static member function of Elem.  This also enables   to choose whether one wants to convert quad4->quad8 or quad4->quad9   through a simple bool option in MeshBase::all_second_order(bool) - reduced repeated code in adjacent_vertices through moving these short   int matrices to Hex  Quad  Prism etc - fixed GMV support for higher-order Prisms (enuff debugging for today...  -),1

Both of these can be explicitly created if they are needed (see meshtool.cc). This reduces object dependencies  and should decrease the size of the Mesh object,0
432,127,ad5126e,2003-10-01 04:02:52,Fixed a bit of documentation for the Mesh.  Specifically  it does not contain a MeshRefinement or BoundaryMesh object  and the docs were changed to reflect that fact.,1

This was the original intent  but CHKERRQ was the only documented function  so that is what I used.,1

609,37,28297b7,2004-03-18 16:41:00,Fixed mainly documentation typos.  Also decided that  although BoundaryInfo::sync() can technically be made const  it is not strictly a const function since it *does modify* the mesh which contains it. Specifically  it sets the subdomain_id for some elements on the boundary. The result is that write_diva() back to non-const for now.,1

624,52,ebcef0b,2004-03-22 22:41:46,cleaned up the trees a bit and added an option to create a tree from the elements directly  bypassing the nodes.  The obvious extension (that I have not made yet) will use the trees (and PointLocators) to find not only elements but also nodes.  Incidentally  the motivation for this was reading a structured surface mesh with a singular axis that contained a number of points at the same physical location in space.  When the target bin size for the tree was less than the number of coincident points an infinite loop was created...  Charming.,0
625,53,e3a6962,2004-03-23 04:17:26,Created a MatlabIO object to handle reading meshes generated in the pdetool program  and removed the previous read_matlab() routines from the MeshBase class.

Also started commenting the reason for inclusion of standard header files  e.g. #include <algorithm> // for std::sort and the like.  Not including C++ header files speeds up compilation times a bit.,1

663,91,d2d8896,2004-05-09 15:40:22,added some comments on TetGen routines,0
664,92,0efbaea,2004-05-11 20:29:07,The partitioners now set a new variable in the Mesh called _n_parts.  This variable was needed since n_subdomains does not map directly to the number of partitions created when using partitioners  and neither does n_processors() since you may partition a mesh on one processor if you wish.  Therefore the partitioners all set the new variable _n_parts in the mesh to allow for this possibility.  The GMV routine now allows you to plot (without error messages) the different partitions of the grid.,1
665,93,daa58e7,2004-05-11 21:18:34,added optimizations for computing edge data in the case of XYZ finite elements,0
666,94,e86b734,2004-05-12 17:26:22,Fixed a small bug where if no linear solver packages were defined  there was a compilation error.  This was due to auto_ptr.h not being included properly in that case.,1

693,121,855649d,2004-05-27 05:04:19,Modified the 14th example a bit more. It is now possible to investigate both adaptive and uniform refinement within the same code  simply by changing the input file.  The adaptive scheme achieves better error reduction in general than the uniform refinement scheme  but both have strange rates  possibly due to the singularity in the solution derivative.  Note: still need,1
697,125,45a3847,2004-06-02 15:08:41,Updated the EquationSystems and System classes to be able to return the number of active dofs  which is defined as the total number of dofs minus the number of constrained dofs.  Also parallelized the exact solution class.,0

SLEPc support makes only sense in combination with the corresponding PETSc version. Hence cofigure checks if both PETSc and SLEPc have the same version numbers. The Interface may only work for the latest SLEPc currently available (2.2.1).,0

998,426,3276f53,2005-05-08 14:11:17,moved MeshBase::contract() up to Mesh.  Unfortunately  there is no good way to make MeshBase::delete_elem() efficient  so the old implementation of MeshBase::contract() was (potentially) O(n_elem^2)  and consumed approximately 20 percent of the runtime in ex10.  This new implementation exploits the fact that the elements are stored in a vector (which is why it was moved up to the Mesh class) and is linear in the number of elements.  The new implementation is less that 1 percent of the run time in ex10.,0

1000,428,ccea24d,2005-05-09 20:38:42,The _elements and _nodes std::vectors have been moved from MeshBase to Mesh at long last.  There are still several lingering design issues which will have to be addressed when additional Mesh subclasses are actually created.  MeshBase now contains a great deal of pure virtual functions which have to be reimplemented in derived classes.  I am certain not all of them will make sense for every subclass  so we will probably end up with another level of abstraction like UnstructuredMesh and then the actual Mesh class.  For now some additional clean-up is probably required  but the examples are running correctly.  I haven't compiled with enable-everything  but if you find something I will try to fix it.,1
