60,60,cb29d56,2008-01-31 11:50:50,Can calculate the distance array without minimum image by setting bpx=None. This makes sense when working on RMS-fitted trajectories which do not obey the original PBC any more. This code avoids having to use a stupid hack like box = 2*box and is perhaps 25% faster by leaving out minimage() This corresponds to r71 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0

74,74,d399950,2008-01-31 11:52:42,Coordinates now returns a brand new array - doesn't break any of the numtools c functions that don't check for contiguity - long term we should fix the c functions to work properly with non-contiguous arrays This corresponds to r87 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1
75,75,c770738,2008-01-31 11:52:49,Under certain circumstances  numframes is not (yet) defined and then repr throws an exception so I removed numframes from the representation.,0
76,76,cfd0d8c,2008-01-31 11:52:56,- distance_array bug: need to copy() to get a contigious array - AROUND selection: if periodic = False then do not use minimum image   convention when looking for neighbours. The default is now True to   get the behaviour from previous version of MDAnalysis.   Note: I'm not sure if the AROUND selection is working properly at         all. It didn't work for me before and it needs to be tested         again.,1
80,80,f76af61,2008-01-31 11:53:27,updated version to 0.5-rc1 in order to put a tar ball up on google code This corresponds to r93 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
81,81,fb1c908,2008-01-31 11:53:36,Release tar ball.  - Change version to 0.5.0  (.0 signifies alpha status  later use a1  a2  b1  b2    after the patch version)  - Added MANIFEST.in to include doc files and all the necessary header files as they are    not automatically picked up by distutils (apparently  a bug: 'getting C library   sources currently broken--no get_source_files() method in build_clib.py')   Also need to pick up all pyrex files and the docs - Revamped docs a little bit. - NOTE: python setup.py install --prefix=mydir is not working properly  it still         tries to install something in the site-wide dir   Added links to googlecode and a template for acknowledgements. - Tested the sdist and managed to compile bot on MAc OS X and Linux (CentOS 4.2 with   modern numpy (> 1.0.3)) - updated CHANGELOG This corresponds to r94 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1
84,3,b53c031,2008-02-10 23:59:51,Added bfactors property to the AtomGroup. It is only set when the structure is loaded from a PDB file. The bfactors array itself is an attribute of the Universe (because it makes no sense to attach it to the time step as it is only defined for a single frame) and handled as a managed attribute in AtomGroups. (Change where bfactors[] resides?),0
85,4,67d7a1a,2008-02-11 18:23:23,numpy.array only makes a copy if you force it. This should fix the problem with AtomGroup.coordinates() function and distance_array,1

93,93,0c907a8,2008-02-28 02:35:29,Universe: Convenience functionality for interactive work: if the dcd argument has a extension 'pdb' then we try to load it as a pdb. The dcd exception handling is not robust enough yet (e.g. segmentation faults occur when accessing self.dcd after erroneously loading a dcd) so we cannot do a simple try: load_dcd() ... except IOError.,0
94,94,2fb5875,2008-02-28 02:45:34,Fixed: check for dcd extension always failed,1

165,111,c5b7c4a,2010-05-01 05:27:04,Gromacs trajectories fixes and improvements - FIXED: trr/xtc tests failed (on Mac OS X) when MDAnalysis was properly installed as a egg directory but not as a developer install: - forgot to include the trr and xtc files in the package - learned that xdrfile_open() segfaults (at least Mac OS X) if there is no file: added additional check to prevent that - Gromacs XDR reader now behave like DCDReader: (1) raise IOError when done  (2) continue raising with repeated next() - for some reason  TRR files can (always??) return status exdrINT at end of file  catch this in _read_next_timestep() - regenerated swig files from libxdrfile.i (only minor doc things),1

For compatibility with the old behaviour  AtomGroup.bfactors   is still a (managed) attribute but this will likely be changed to a method in   the 0.8 release to have a more uniform interface - Fixed a bug with the Bio.PDB reader: in the absence of a segid in the file it   would throw an error,1
