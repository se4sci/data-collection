319e53c,Summary: patch to resolve issue 43--whitespace is no longer required around the parentheses in selectAtoms strings. In module MDAnalysis/core/Selection.py and class SelectionParser  the method parse(self selectstr) now adds bounding whitespace around the input string so the parser can handle a lack of whitespace. Method __consume_token(self) in the same class has also been streamlined to incorporate the built-in pop() method rather than the more verbose alternative in place. The changes pass the unit test introduced in r456 and the enhancement has been added to the CHANGELOG.,2018,,,yes,1538151132.447825

8aa93ba,Velocities may now be accessed from GRO files as AtomGroup.velocities() or Atom.velocity   A velocity unit test was included with this commit to verify that both the AtomGroup and Atom-specific velocity reading functionalities are preserved for GRO files.

23a1bb7,Support for PDBs with 4 character resnames and segID output when writing (PrimitivePDBWriter) (Issue 63  patch by dcaplan) - When I try to read and write PDBs with 4 character resnames used in NAMD/VMD I end up with an improperly formatted PDB file. This is also an issue with segIDs not being written. - I've made a quick patch where I add support for 4 character resnames and change the format string for the output to write the segID. I also added very simple support for better guessing of atom types since the function guess_atom_type was just returning 0. - I'm still not sure about how to deal with the 2 types of format strings for writing PDBs.,2018,,,yes,1538150717.927049

aed5881,AtomGroup: indexing reworked  implemented advanced slicing (Issue 36) - indexing of AtomGroup now always behaves like a list: integer --> Atom  slice --> AtomGroup  list/array --> AtomGroup (NEW  fixes Issue 36) - added test cases and modified older test cases (basically  atoms[:] cannot   be used to test for equality as it is now a AtomGroup  use ._atoms. - updated CHANGELOG (reorganized with a big AtomGroup section),2018,,,yes,1538150577.284082

ee0da3c,MDAnalysis now truncates atom numbers when writing .gro files with more than 99 999 atoms  in a manner consistent with genbox in GROMACS 4.6.3. Note that it appears that some GROMACS utilities (i.e.  trjconv) actually write 00000 instead of 0 for the 100 000th atom. Both formats can be read in by MDAnalysis and VMD  and this is (overall) an improvement that allows us to write large .gro files in a workable manner. Fixes #550.,2018,,,yes,1538150060.517109

f0b2076,patch 57b by jandom: completes the fix of Issue 57 (coordinate checking of GRO/PDB writers) - From http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/gro.html    - position (in nm  x y z in 3 columns  each 8 positions with 3 decimal places)    - velocity (in nm/ps (or km/s)  x y z in 3 columns  each 8 positions with 4 decimal places)   Does that mean a max values of 9999.999/-999.999 for coords and same for velocities  but with the decimal moved a digit to left? - added validation for gro writing  moved the coordinate checking method to parent writer class.,2018,,,yes,1538149421.991203
b992af4,minor error correctionin mdamath.py,2018,,,yes,1538149415.065869

97e5ab6,fixed race conditions in test suite - any tests that relied on values of the internal flags have been   changed so that they set behaviour through keyword arguments instead    of manipulating flags - affects gromacs conversion of length (GRO  XTC  TRR) with the convert_gromacs_length   flag and the use of the permissive PDB reader (permissive_pdb_reader flag) - tests could fail when they were performed in parallel and different test threads   changed the global flags - added a fes tests to check for the default values but DO NOT USE THE FLAGS during   testing,2018,,,yes,1538149362.076686
861639e,fixed race conditions in test suite - any tests that relied on values of the internal flags have been   changed so that they set behaviour through keyword arguments instead    of manipulating flags - affects gromacs conversion of length (GRO  XTC  TRR) with the convert_gromacs_length   flag and the use of the permissive PDB reader (permissive_pdb_reader flag) - tests could fail when they were performed in parallel and different test threads   changed the global flags - added a fes tests to check for the default values but DO NOT USE THE FLAGS during   testing,2018,,,yes,1538149360.835009
fba0d98,completed FIX of Issue 45 - delete universes in tearDown() AND any references held in other data structures - reduced the maximum memory footprint to <512MB (roughly) of one test process - tests run faster again (with --processes=2 I get 109s on my MacBook Pro 2-core for ~170 tests,2018,,,yes,1538149345.082166
48f2fb2,analysis.align: quick hacks to make it work again - must use an atom selection for the writer (workaround for Issue 49 when writing to a PDB or GRO) - added tol_mass parameter to avoid raising an exception for small mass differences (e.g. when   one structure is defined via a psf and the other via a pdb with atom mass heuristics) - fixed the progress counter (maybe use analysis.util.progress_meter instead?),2018,,,yes,1538149341.885909
d1ffce7,fixed Issue 57: optimized patch and added test case - moved the coordinate check out of the loop and test the whole coordinate array in one   go (better performance but error reporting is worse because we do not report the offending   atom anymore) - remove the opened PDB file before raising the ValueError - added test case (should have had one for PrimitivePDBWriter anyway...),2018,,,yes,1538149336.128259

d014d41,FIXED Issue 37: simulation box were not converted - added coordinates.core.triclinic_box() and triclinic_vectors() to handle conversion - added function convert_dimensions_to_unitcell() to Writers   and added to the requirements of the Trajectory API - GROWriter: introduced a temporary GROWriterStandard class which will replace the current   GROWriter (which got a DeprecationWarning),2018,,,yes,1538149179.233055
9ecb534,new attributes for Atom: radius and bfactor - enhanced Atom object with the radius value (read by the PQR reader) and   added radii() to AtomGroup  this should make it easier to handle PQR files - changed the way that B-factors were stored: they are now also store with   each individual Atom. For compatibility with the old behaviour  AtomGroup.bfactors   is still a (managed) attribute but this will likely be changed to a method in   the 0.8 release to have a more uniform interface - Fixed a bug with the Bio.PDB reader: in the absence of a segid in the file it   would throw an error,2018,,,yes,1538149169.434523
Feb0722,H-bonding analysis now defaults to updating selections each time step (fixes Issue 138),2018,,,yes,1538149160.933883
ea8f40c,Gromacs trajectories fixes and improvements - FIXED: trr/xtc tests failed (on Mac OS X) when MDAnalysis was properly installed   as a egg directory but not as a developer install:   - forgot to include the trr and xtc files in the package   - learned that xdrfile_open() segfaults (at least Mac OS X) if     there is no file: added additional check to prevent that - Gromacs XDR reader now behave like DCDReader:   (1) raise IOError when done    (2) continue raising with repeated next() - for some reason  TRR files can (always??) return status exdrINT at end of file  catch   this in _read_next_timestep() - regenerated swig files from libxdrfile.i (only minor doc things),2018,,,yes,1538149159.634575

44eb889,fixed: PDB writer would fail if atom type was an integer - use new guess_atom_element() which right now just does the same as guess_atom_type()   to always guess the element from the atomname - improved guess_atom_type() by also checking for names that start with numbers   such as some hydrogen atoms,2018,,,yes,1538149153.353602
8b07211,updated a number of examples - write figures to ./figures subdirectory - write data to ./output - added example output and figures for blocks.py  backbone_dihedrals.py    radial_distribution_function.py - fixed/update a number of examples   - blocks.py: block averaging (see example in the paper)   - radial_distribution_function.py: g(r)  this is the optimized version     (see paper) with correct normalisation   - backbone_dihedral.py: example for Timeseries.Collection and use of the     new special Residue.phi_selection() and Residue.psi_selection() methods     for the common backbone dihedrals  script is now ran on the DIMS AdK     trajectory and produces a figure   - TODO: other scripts - made all scripts executable,2018,,,yes,1538149146.304891
9d515b3,"A few changes in sphinx configuration to make it more close to the default configuration. doc/Makefile fixed so ""make clean"" actually cleans something",2018,,,yes,1538149069.1432
ff0e5d0,-resolves Issue 188 regarding Helanal Finish argument: -new unit test for fix: basically raise an Exception to indicate that Finish time specified by user is before the trajectory start time,2018,,,yes,1538149052.072418
1adeb82,CRDReader streamlined and improved - fixed default unit as Angstrom  but that did not   have any influence on the behaviour so far) - added official CRD format to the comments for future reference - improved robustness of EXT detection by using a staged detection of   lines (continue blocks) and checking length of fields - added additional sanity check on the number of atoms (which we can   get from the CRD header),2018,,,yes,1538149048.71708
fba80e2,Port lib/test_util.py to pytest (#1413),2018,,,yes,1538149040.443339
0114e6a,converted all TABs to spaces (Issue 69) - used emacs 'untabify' on all files  see   http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/detail?id=69#c1 - unit tests pass - TODO: add marker lines for editors (do this together with a   fix for Issue 68),2018,,,yes,1538149036.041408
4cfbf64,Distance selections: - AROUND and POINT work when applied to a universe (there's still a   bug present that prevents proper use with AtomGroups)  I fixed a bug   that made these selections spit out total garbage or crash - AROUND uses by default KDTree neighbor search and is about 7x faster   than the distance matrix based routine (still  it is even better to   explicitly construct such selections with AtomGroups and   KDTree.NeighborSearch.AtomNeighborSearch),2018,,,yes,1538149031.200701
4e727ff,FIXED Issue 47 (attribute residue selection from segname now always returns a ResidueGroup) - changes old undocumented behaviour and MIGHT BREAK CODE - also documented the Segment.r<resid> selection but made it 1-based   (makes more sense from the user point of view as all structures/topologies start   numbering at 1 and not at 0 - updated CHANGELOG - tests pass (including the one for Issue 47),2018,,,yes,1538148902.121287
4aaeaae,example scripts improvements and additions - added examples for simple and fancy rms fitting - added graph for the simple fitting - fixed: filename for g(r) example,2018,,,yes,1538148900.790822
4dc0d3d,Release 0.5.1: bugfixes and some enhancements that accrued over the last few months (see CHANGELOG for details). - LICENSE was updated with the UIUC Open Source License (catdcd code) - updated email addresses etc in README - updated TODO (distance_array bug fixed) - added keyword expansion for some of the doc files so that Id lines are   properly shown,2018,,,yes,1538148894.420617

b37a7b5,CHARMM CRD format: fixed a few inconsistencies in the Writer - TotRes is really 5 digits wide (not 4)  - x y z are 10 wide (not 9) - should have been not really a problem because we had simply padded the   fields so everything was in the right colum  technically  one could have had problems for totres > 9999   and coordinates >99999.999 - make sure to strip to larger values when writing extended format,2018,,,yes,1538148886.712932
6ee42c3,additional testcases - added testcases for selections (but need more)   NOTE: testcase for Issue 43 (parenthesis without spaces) will currently throw and ERROR         until Issue 43 is fixed - added initial testcases for important methods of AtomGroup,2018,,,yes,1538148880.240731
d399950,Coordinates now returns a brand new array - doesn't break any of the numtools c functions that don't check for contiguity - long term we should fix the c functions to work properly with non-contiguous arrays This corresponds to r87 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,,yes,1538148870.488982
9199c09,fixed: Bug in psf parser would not read charges correctly. Eg 0.900000E-01 would be read as 0.9 and not lead to an exception. This means that anything done with MDAnalysis and charge analysis in the past needs to be rechecked. I referencedd the Charmm source code for the authoritative PSF format. This corresponds to r51 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,,yes,1538148866.247519
c88e3fe,Fixed a bug I must have introduced when trying to make PSF reading faster by preallocating the bond  angle  etc lists  but I was only including the last item that was read in each line - also disabled building of bondlists on each atom for the Bond selection  since noone's using it and it really slows down reading a psf This corresponds to r22 in /code/MDAnalysis.,2018,,,yes,1538148864.431424

792533c,* primitive PDB writer: only works if structure was read as a pdb. It   simply replaces the pdb coordinates with the time step coordinates.   For something more complicated we should have segment and residue   lists in MDAnalysis (perhaps save them when reading the psf). * added filename attribute to both DCDReader and PDBReader to make it   easier to write unified code.

cfd0d8c,- distance_array bug: need to copy() to get a contigious array - AROUND selection: if periodic = False then do not use minimum image   convention when looking for neighbours. The default is now True to   get the behaviour from previous version of MDAnalysis.   Note: I'm not sure if the AROUND selection is working properly at         all. It didn't work for me before and it needs to be tested         again.,2018,,,no,1538149403.28706
309970.0,additional tests for coordinate readers - more GRO tests  coordinates and distances fail at the moment because the GRO reader   does not convert units (TO BE FIXED) - more tests for PDB files - use GRO parser for the XTC and TRR tests instead of PDB (a bit faster and more native),2018,,,no,1538149358.245889
52728c8,make AtomGroup.coordinates() return an array of type numpy.float32 by default - distance array needs float32 and when interfacing with I/O this is also   how coordinates are stored so it makes sense to enforce it at this   crucial entry point - LeafletFinder would raise an error when building the adjacency matrix   because the array returned by coordinates() was float64,2018,,,no,1538149332.854685
