19,319e53c,Summary: patch to resolve issue 43--whitespace is no longer required around the parentheses in selectAtoms strings. In module MDAnalysis/core/Selection.py and class SelectionParser  the method parse(self selectstr) now adds bounding whitespace around the input string so the parser can handle a lack of whitespace. Method __consume_token(self) in the same class has also been streamlined to incorporate the built-in pop() method rather than the more verbose alternative in place. The changes pass the unit test introduced in r456 and the enhancement has been added to the CHANGELOG.,1

83,6c788c6,fixes stochasticproxembed.pyx Cython compilation error,1
84,6ff313f,Frame writer can take a Universe (fixes one half of Issue 49) - added universe attribute to Universe - altered GRO  CRD  and PrimitivePDB writer so that they can   deal with a Universe as argument (just get the coordinates from   the atoms instead of the 'selection' --- no performance penalty    just making use of the improved hierarchy and the fact that   .atoms is now a true AtomGroup) - added test case (passes),1
85,8aa93ba,Velocities may now be accessed from GRO files as AtomGroup.velocities() or Atom.velocity   A velocity unit test was included with this commit to verify that both the AtomGroup and Atom-specific velocity reading functionalities are preserved for GRO files.

88,7de8cb2,New fixer dealing with torsion to dihedral conversions (Issue#373) involving AtomGroup / atom / universe. Crude examples for testing also added.,1
89,23a1bb7,Support for PDBs with 4 character resnames and segID output when writing (PrimitivePDBWriter) (Issue 63  patch by dcaplan) - When I try to read and write PDBs with 4 character resnames used in NAMD/VMD I end up with an improperly formatted PDB file. This is also an issue with segIDs not being written. - I've made a quick patch where I add support for 4 character resnames and change the format string for the output to write the segID. I also added very simple support for better guessing of atom types since the function guess_atom_type was just returning 0. - I'm still not sure about how to deal with the 2 types of format strings for writing PDBs.,1
90,bf338f5,"Issue #6: ""accessing coordinate functions of universe segments fails"" was caused by my previous skipping of the check for an empty AtomGroup. Reverted to previous version.",1
91,13e7f7d,chain reader added (Issue 39) - universe can read a list of files and concatenate them transparently   on the fly: u = Universe(PSF  [DCD_1  DCD_2  ...]) - only basic Trajectory API implemented (no indexing/slicing!) - can mix any formats (!) - added simple test case,1

93,b4a70b5,Many different code corrections according to code review (on Issue 228). Inculding: testsuites for topology reader were added. testsuites for topology reader were modified.,1
94,aed5881,AtomGroup: indexing reworked  implemented advanced slicing (Issue 36) - indexing of AtomGroup now always behaves like a list: integer --> Atom  slice --> AtomGroup  list/array --> AtomGroup (NEW  fixes Issue 36) - added test cases and modified older test cases (basically  atoms[:] cannot   be used to test for equality as it is now a AtomGroup  use ._atoms. - updated CHANGELOG (reorganized with a big AtomGroup section),1

211,ee0da3c,MDAnalysis now truncates atom numbers when writing .gro files with more than 99 999 atoms  in a manner consistent with genbox in GROMACS 4.6.3. Note that it appears that some GROMACS utilities (i.e.  trjconv) actually write 00000 instead of 0 for the 100 000th atom. Both formats can be read in by MDAnalysis and VMD  and this is (overall) an improvement that allows us to write large .gro files in a workable manner. Fixes #550.,1

231,fba0d98,completed FIX of Issue 45 - delete universes in tearDown() AND any references held in other data structures - reduced the maximum memory footprint to <512MB (roughly) of one test process - tests run faster again (with --processes=2 I get 109s on my MacBook Pro 2-core for ~170 tests,1
232,48f2fb2,analysis.align: quick hacks to make it work again - must use an atom selection for the writer (workaround for Issue 49 when writing to a PDB or GRO) - added tol_mass parameter to avoid raising an exception for small mass differences (e.g. when   one structure is defined via a psf and the other via a pdb with atom mass heuristics) - fixed the progress counter (maybe use analysis.util.progress_meter instead?),1
233,d1ffce7,fixed Issue 57: optimized patch and added test case - moved the coordinate check out of the loop and test the whole coordinate array in one   go (better performance but error reporting is worse because we do not report the offending   atom anymore) - remove the opened PDB file before raising the ValueError - added test case (should have had one for PrimitivePDBWriter anyway...),1

239,be8db1c,Port auxiliary module to pytest (#1439),1
240,d014d41,FIXED Issue 37: simulation box were not converted - added coordinates.core.triclinic_box() and triclinic_vectors() to handle conversion - added function convert_dimensions_to_unitcell() to Writers   and added to the requirements of the Trajectory API - GROWriter: introduced a temporary GROWriterStandard class which will replace the current   GROWriter (which got a DeprecationWarning),1
241,9ecb534,new attributes for Atom: radius and bfactor - enhanced Atom object with the radius value (read by the PQR reader) and   added radii() to AtomGroup  this should make it easier to handle PQR files - changed the way that B-factors were stored: they are now also store with   each individual Atom. For compatibility with the old behaviour  AtomGroup.bfactors   is still a (managed) attribute but this will likely be changed to a method in   the 0.8 release to have a more uniform interface - Fixed a bug with the Bio.PDB reader: in the absence of a segid in the file it   would throw an error,1
242,Feb0722,H-bonding analysis now defaults to updating selections each time step (fixes Issue 138),1
243,ea8f40c,Gromacs trajectories fixes and improvements - FIXED: trr/xtc tests failed (on Mac OS X) when MDAnalysis was properly installed   as a egg directory but not as a developer install:   - forgot to include the trr and xtc files in the package   - learned that xdrfile_open() segfaults (at least Mac OS X) if     there is no file: added additional check to prevent that - Gromacs XDR reader now behave like DCDReader:   (1) raise IOError when done    (2) continue raising with repeated next() - for some reason  TRR files can (always??) return status exdrINT at end of file  catch   this in _read_next_timestep() - regenerated swig files from libxdrfile.i (only minor doc things),1

245,44eb889,fixed: PDB writer would fail if atom type was an integer - use new guess_atom_element() which right now just does the same as guess_atom_type()   to always guess the element from the atomname - improved guess_atom_type() by also checking for names that start with numbers   such as some hydrogen atoms,1
246,8b07211,updated a number of examples - write figures to ./figures subdirectory - write data to ./output - added example output and figures for blocks.py  backbone_dihedrals.py    radial_distribution_function.py - fixed/update a number of examples   - blocks.py: block averaging (see example in the paper)   - radial_distribution_function.py: g(r)  this is the optimized version     (see paper) with correct normalisation   - backbone_dihedral.py: example for Timeseries.Collection and use of the     new special Residue.phi_selection() and Residue.psi_selection() methods     for the common backbone dihedrals  script is now ran on the DIMS AdK     trajectory and produces a figure   - TODO: other scripts - made all scripts executable,1
247,9d515b3,"A few changes in sphinx configuration to make it more close to the default configuration. doc/Makefile fixed so ""make clean"" actually cleans something",1
248,ff0e5d0,-resolves Issue 188 regarding Helanal Finish argument: -new unit test for fix: basically raise an Exception to indicate that Finish time specified by user is before the trajectory start time,1
249,1adeb82,CRDReader streamlined and improved - fixed default unit as Angstrom  but that did not   have any influence on the behaviour so far) - added official CRD format to the comments for future reference - improved robustness of EXT detection by using a staged detection of   lines (continue blocks) and checking length of fields - added additional sanity check on the number of atoms (which we can   get from the CRD header),1
250,fba80e2,Port lib/test_util.py to pytest (#1413),1
251,0114e6a,converted all TABs to spaces (Issue 69) - used emacs 'untabify' on all files  see   http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/detail?id=69#c1 - unit tests pass - TODO: add marker lines for editors (do this together with a   fix for Issue 68),1
252,4cfbf64,Distance selections: - AROUND and POINT work when applied to a universe (there's still a   bug present that prevents proper use with AtomGroups)  I fixed a bug   that made these selections spit out total garbage or crash - AROUND uses by default KDTree neighbor search and is about 7x faster   than the distance matrix based routine (still  it is even better to   explicitly construct such selections with AtomGroups and   KDTree.NeighborSearch.AtomNeighborSearch),1
253,4e727ff,FIXED Issue 47 (attribute residue selection from segname now always returns a ResidueGroup) - changes old undocumented behaviour and MIGHT BREAK CODE - also documented the Segment.r<resid> selection but made it 1-based   (makes more sense from the user point of view as all structures/topologies start   numbering at 1 and not at 0 - updated CHANGELOG - tests pass (including the one for Issue 47),1
254,4aaeaae,example scripts improvements and additions - added examples for simple and fancy rms fitting - added graph for the simple fitting - fixed: filename for g(r) example,1
255,4dc0d3d,Release 0.5.1: bugfixes and some enhancements that accrued over the last few months (see CHANGELOG for details). - LICENSE was updated with the UIUC Open Source License (catdcd code) - updated email addresses etc in README - updated TODO (distance_array bug fixed) - added keyword expansion for some of the doc files so that Id lines are   properly shown,1

257,dbdaf60,install pytest >= 3.1.2 (#1447),1
258,2364f13,Pytest Stylecore/test_topology.py (#1621),1
259,b37a7b5,CHARMM CRD format: fixed a few inconsistencies in the Writer - TotRes is really 5 digits wide (not 4)  - x y z are 10 wide (not 9) - should have been not really a problem because we had simply padded the   fields so everything was in the right colum  technically  one could have had problems for totres > 9999   and coordinates >99999.999 - make sure to strip to larger values when writing extended format,1
260,6ee42c3,additional testcases - added testcases for selections (but need more)   NOTE: testcase for Issue 43 (parenthesis without spaces) will currently throw and ERROR         until Issue 43 is fixed - added initial testcases for important methods of AtomGroup,1
261,d399950,Coordinates now returns a brand new array - doesn't break any of the numtools c functions that don't check for contiguity - long term we should fix the c functions to work properly with non-contiguous arrays This corresponds to r87 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1
262,9199c09,fixed: Bug in psf parser would not read charges correctly. Eg 0.900000E-01 would be read as 0.9 and not lead to an exception. This means that anything done with MDAnalysis and charge analysis in the past needs to be rechecked. I referencedd the Charmm source code for the authoritative PSF format. This corresponds to r51 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1
263,c88e3fe,Fixed a bug I must have introduced when trying to make PSF reading faster by preallocating the bond  angle  etc lists  but I was only including the last item that was read in each line - also disabled building of bondlists on each atom for the Bond selection  since noone's using it and it really slows down reading a psf This corresponds to r22 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1
264,6975481.0,fixed: some tests did not remove temporary files - added forgotten import os so that files get properly unlinked - problem was silently ignored because I had put it in an indiscriminate   try...except: pass block... d'oh - now only pass if os.unlink(temp) produces OSError  otherwise raise,1
265,67d7a1a,numpy.array only makes a copy if you force it. This should fix the problem with AtomGroup.coordinates() function and distance_array,1
266,c7e2a6a,- fixed installation bug  can now do 'python setyp.py --prefix=~/my/pydir' at the cost of not installing the docs  however it's not really clear where the docs should go. > - new scheme for labelling UNSTABLE releases: get global revision with svnversion and put this number + 1 into RELESE. This way we weill be able to produce nice svn snapshot tarballs.,1
267,02e9bce,- CRDWriter added (denniej0) - fixed a bug in PrimitivePDBWriter: would only work if run from a base AtomGroup  not a derived   class such as a segment - updated CHANGELOG and TODO,1
268,1433d0a,added test case for DCDWriter unitcell fix (and updated CHANGELOG),1
269,d85833d,FIXED: test_write_selection: Test writing CA atoms to external file. (I had forgotten to add blanket kwargs to the GRO reader  which is required so that one can pass numatoms=None as required by the revised Trajectory API.),1
270,a49584c,Fixed some timeseries bugs - upgraded to work with numpy. Now individual timeseries objects can be treated like numpy arrays This corresponds to r56 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1
271,86cf7d9,fixed Issue 66: supply generated C files so that only developers need Cython - provide generated C files - provide simple setup.py (for users) and setup_developers.py,1
272,87cd8dd,FIXED Issue 33: principleAxes() return values are confusing - new principalAxes() method (correct name  too  as a bonus) that returns   the three eigenvectors directly and does not require unpacking - kept old method bu deprecated it,1
273,7053bf8,Possibly FIXED Issue 27 (at least on Mac OS X 10.6) This bug is of little consequence to the user because the DCD _dcd_header() function was only implemented for debugging purposes and never documented  it should not be used in code.,1
274,5df264e,ENH: Fixed an IOError message in libdcd.pyx that referred to TRR files instead of DCD files.,1
275,9e0e37b,Fixed some bugs with equality testing using == instead of 'is'  also added potential_profile example This corresponds to r67 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1
276,3a7fe45,fixed Issue 70 (instant selection of atoms in residues that are also termini) - removed caching of atoms in Residue - decreases performance (probably) but at least returns correct selections,1
277,18ec2db,fixed protein selection: Charmm Histidine residues were left out of the protein selection This corresponds to r63 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1
278,3b16db1,fixed Issue 59 (naveen.michaudagrawal) -- DCDWriter now checks input coordinate array for continguousness - Because DCD's store the data in fortran format  ie a single timestep is (x x x ...  y y y...  z z z...) and through the magic of numpy arrays that's usually transparently handled.,1
279,b946c38,Issue 64 fixed: universe.trajectory.delta values are rounded when read from the dcd header file (This used to be rounded to 4 decimals but people suggested that the full precision would be better.),1
280,b417d5d,minor omissions fixed - CHANGELOG: oops  AtomGroup._atoms is still here and really necessary - setup.py: added scipy as a requirement for analysis (needed for   sparse matrix in contact_matrix()),1
281,68dc377,fixed: 'from MDAnalysis import *' did not get Universe and collection into the main name space (in the same way as the old MDAnalysis did),1
282,fd540ca,Fixed a bug with loading new dcds into a universe  where each atom would refer to a previous dcd's timestep object This corresponds to r18 in /code/MDAnalysis.,1

1141,f71c4e0,New: selection can write snapshot to a pdb file (EXPERIMENTAL) - added a simple PDB writer that does not require Bio.PDB (should rewrite PDBWriter) - added core.util for helper functions like filename mangling - small steps towards a unified trajectory API:   . universe.trajectory points to the reader object   . coord.__init__ advertises readers  writers in dicts,0

1144,8bfa301,tests: made coordinates test work consistently  also for crd - changed precisions to match the file format (e.g. 3 for pdb and 5   for crd)  otherwise the tests do not pass consistently) - new crd file that matches the small pdb so that we can use the same   tester class,0
1145,8cfd130,Universe can read a structure from a PDB file * added PDB module  the reader is attempting to fake the DCDReader * PDB uses BioPython * added pdb managed attribute to Universe class.,0

1147,7129ae7,use PrimitivePDBReader as default PDB reader - Bio.PDB's reader can drop atoms when they have the same name   in a residue (which happens for systems generated from MD simulations)   The PrimitivePDBReader copes just fine with thos cases (but does   not handle esoteric PDB features such as alternative atoms and   insertion codes that are not needed for handling MD simulation data). - The default behaviour of MDAnalysis can be set through the flag       MDAnalysis.core.flag['permissive_pdb_reader']   The default is True. - One can always manually select the PDB reader by providing the   permissive keyword to Universe  e.g. Universe(... permissive=False)   will read the input file with the Bio.PDB reader. This might be   useful when processing true Protein Databank PDB files.,0

1173,792533c,* primitive PDB writer: only works if structure was read as a pdb. It   simply replaces the pdb coordinates with the time step coordinates.   For something more complicated we should have segment and residue   lists in MDAnalysis (perhaps save them when reading the psf). * added filename attribute to both DCDReader and PDBReader to make it   easier to write unified code.

1191,52728c8,make AtomGroup.coordinates() return an array of type numpy.float32 by default - distance array needs float32 and when interfacing with I/O this is also   how coordinates are stored so it makes sense to enforce it at this   crucial entry point - LeafletFinder would raise an error when building the adjacency matrix   because the array returned by coordinates() was float64,0

2259,2a09f62,Only provide setup.cfg.template and let the user copy and modify it. This is better because otherwise local modifications mess up svn.,0
2260,63e9b86,* new water dipole correl time series: calculates the vector of   the dipole moment of a rigid 3-site water model * sanitized formatting of correl.h (sorry) * started using specific Exceptions instead of the generic one,0
2261,57a2bbb,Universe now knows the filename of the psf file it was built from  dcd and pdb instances also have the filename attribute.,0

2264,4bbbabf,Added Ben's authorship.,0
2265,85b6118,House keeping: - added generated files to svn:ignore - added a little bit to TODO and made sure that it gets into the tar ball,0
2266,1a7b735,new attribute 'filename' (just initializes to 'dcdfilename') (also previously added to the PDBReader class): By having a common API for PDBReader and DCDReader on can more easily write code that can transparently use either.,0
2267,5cc4ef5,bumped release but include devel,0
2268,24827d9,unittests: new tests for distance_array() and self_distance_array() - added distance array tests  including known failures with copy=False - classified the XTC/TRR tests as slow - updated docs on testing considerably - moved filenames needed for all unittests into separate module NOTE: test target values were obtaine on my Macbook running python 2.6  OS X 10.6.3  this version of MDAnalysis  the should probably be checked against independent evidence such as VMD measure().,0
2269,b53c031,Added bfactors property to the AtomGroup. It is only set when the structure is loaded from a PDB file. The bfactors array itself is an attribute of the Universe (because it makes no sense to attach it to the time step as it is only defined for a single frame) and handled as a managed attribute in AtomGroups. (Change where bfactors[] resides?),0
2270,6ba94a7,libxdr: added function to count the number of frames in a trajectory - read_xtc_numframes() and read_trr_numframes() do the brain-damaged thing and   iterate through all frames  in particular for trr one should be able to do better - maybe cache the frame offsets and in this way implement random access (LOOS seems to be doing   something like this) - added a few simple test cases,0
2271,aae6305,Universe init -  commented out debugging messages when building topology - changed vanilla exceptions to either NotImplementedError or ValueError (until   we define better custom exceptions),0
2272,3f067a6,moved SelectionError into top level,0

2276,ff38143,reST docs for top __init__ & canonical licence blurb header,0
2277,ceca351,contacts analysis: working and added reST docs,0
2278,c2ef173,asUniverse() convenience method added to unify input - useful for analysis input: either take a universe  a single   filename (PDB)  or a tuple (topology trajectory) and return   a universe - imported at top level (SUBJECT TO CHANGE!) - also more reST doc for AtomGroup,0
2279,787a5a7,additional requirements (I thought this was added already but must have lost it),0

2325,a111720,analysis contacts: dcd --> trajectory (although will break for XTC at the moment if no reference structures supplied),0
2326,c3822a2,trajectory reader improvements: slices - XTC/TRR reader can do simple slices by sequential iteration - moved some functionality from DCDReader into the base class TrjReader - added explicitly required methods to TrjReader (cf Trajectory API)   mostly with NotImplementedError - enabled reverse iteration for the DCDReader (but disabled for XTC/TRR   because it would require re-seeking every single frame from the beginning) - UnitTests for slices,0
2327,85e9399,transformation improvements - added align_principalAxis() method to AtomGroup - added two helpers to transformations - added transform(4x4matrix) to AtomGroup - also made AtomGroup.dihedral() raise ValueError if the group has not   4 members.,0

2333,4a637c2,"documentation enhancements and configuration changes - added overview (not finished) and page on selections (goes beyond the current   online docs and includes the docs on instant selectors) - maded analysis modules separate pages (otherwise the analysis page becomes very   long and cluttered) - renamed the top level file to index because that makes it easier to serve it   via apache - configuration file changes     - bumped version/release     - put authors in one variable and also added Joe     - removed most of the special sphinx modules  only kept autodoc and intersphinx        add the others peicewise when needed (also might help to reduce weird sphinx       errors)     - added links for intersphinx (but commented out during development because       loading the objects.inv always takes a while)     - removed all path fiddling  simply use full import names in docs.

3204,54b2860,MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines adjusted in the following ways: -an ImportError with appropriate message should now be raised when a non-standard dependency of this module is not available (rather than a print statement only) -the only non-standard (i.e.  outside of regular MDAnalysis) module requirement has been simplified to matplotlib.nxutils  and ideally this requirement will eventually be removed because it is a deprecated module of matplotlib (and also an analytical rather than plotting use of matplotlib) -the standard dependencies (MDAnalysis  multiprocessing  numpy  scipy) are now imported in separate statements for improved dependency sanity -a substantial amount of extraneous debugging code has been removed (although a bit more clean-up could likely still be done) -the placeholder main() function has been renamed to generate_streamlines() and the workflow may eventually be adjusted (perhaps encapsulated in a class),0
