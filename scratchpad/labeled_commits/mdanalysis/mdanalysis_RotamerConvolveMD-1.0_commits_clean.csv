2319431,2008-01-31 11:44:48,Why was I ever returning a copy of the timestep when using the indexing notation on the dcd reader? Who knows what I was thinkingsvn status This corresponds to r21 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
c88e3fe,2008-01-31 11:44:55,Fixed a bug I must have introduced when trying to make PSF reading faster by preallocating the bond  angle  etc lists  but I was only including the last item that was read in each line - also disabled building of bondlists on each atom for the Bond selection  since noone's using it and it really slows down reading a psf This corresponds to r22 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
b3f6a4e,2008-01-31 11:45:02,Fixed Timeseries so that you can pass in an AtomGroup This corresponds to r23 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0

ab34cb3,2008-01-31 11:47:57,* in comments: changes to make it compile on Mac OS X 10.3.9 without intel compiler and libs. The current version still compiles as before with intel. * added the numpy includes to rms fitting as well (otherwise it failed for me) This corresponds to r49 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
e76542d,2008-01-31 11:48:04,use numpy.linalg (with old Numeric LinearAlgebra it does not work anymore) This corresponds to r50 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
9199c09,2008-01-31 11:48:11,fixed: Bug in psf parser would not read charges correctly. Eg 0.900000E-01 would be read as 0.9 and not lead to an exception. This means that anything done with MDAnalysis and charge analysis in the past needs to be rechecked. I referencedd the Charmm source code for the authoritative PSF format. This corresponds to r51 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
0bd1bdf,2008-01-31 11:48:18,Tidied up the AtomGroup class and fixed a few minor bugs This corresponds to r52 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0

8cfd130,2008-01-31 11:49:34,Universe can read a structure from a PDB file * added PDB module  the reader is attempting to fake the DCDReader * PDB uses BioPython * added pdb managed attribute to Universe class.,0
18ec2db,2008-01-31 11:49:47,fixed protein selection: Charmm Histidine residues were left out of the protein selection This corresponds to r63 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
071b3c1,2008-01-31 11:49:54,fixed: centerOfMass()  centerOfGeometry()  radiusOfGyration() were broken because numpy.sum() now HAS to include the axis This corresponds to r64 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
18f927d,2008-01-31 11:50:04,Added doc strings to most of the python code This corresponds to r65 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
51319af,2008-01-31 11:50:13,Documentation for the atomSelection function - also added Point selection to select atoms around a point  optimized around point and property selections This corresponds to r66 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
9e0e37b,2008-01-31 11:50:21,Fixed some bugs with equality testing using == instead of 'is'  also added potential_profile example This corresponds to r67 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
803b03d,2008-01-31 11:50:28,Fixed a typo in name of function in DCD class This corresponds to r68 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0

8a26aa3,2008-01-31 11:50:42,Re-added HSE HSD  etc by merge -r65:63 (somehow got lost).,0
cb29d56,2008-01-31 11:50:50,Can calculate the distance array without minimum image by setting bpx=None. This makes sense when working on RMS-fitted trajectories which do not obey the original PBC any more. This code avoids having to use a stupid hack like box = 2*box and is perhaps 25% faster by leaving out minimage() This corresponds to r71 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
5d61666,2008-01-31 11:50:57,fixed: AROUND selection (Naveen) This corresponds to r72 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
85ea1bd,2008-01-31 11:51:04,Subselections on AtomGroup  also incorporated 'all' selection This corresponds to r73 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
6b80874,2008-01-31 11:51:11,Now rms_fitting can compile with both OS X VecLib and Intel MKL without changing headers This corresponds to r74 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
c4d8fc2,2008-01-31 11:51:19,Forgot to actually parse the 'all' token in selections This corresponds to r75 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
617c3f2,2008-01-31 11:51:26,Fixed coordinate based selections on AtomGroups This corresponds to r76 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
a568244,2008-01-31 11:51:33,Stupid difference in numpy.nonzero between versions of numpy - later versions return a tuple This corresponds to r77 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
5fe1352,2008-01-31 11:51:49,fixed sanity check on result (seg faulted before),0

eee8a69,2008-01-31 11:52:35,LAMMPSParser: proper psf formatting This corresponds to r86 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
d399950,2008-01-31 11:52:42,Coordinates now returns a brand new array - doesn't break any of the numtools c functions that don't check for contiguity - long term we should fix the c functions to work properly with non-contiguous arrays This corresponds to r87 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
c770738,2008-01-31 11:52:49,Under certain circumstances  numframes is not (yet) defined and then repr throws an exception so I removed numframes from the representation.,0
cfd0d8c,2008-01-31 11:52:56,- distance_array bug: need to copy() to get a contigious array - AROUND selection: if periodic = False then do not use minimum image   convention when looking for neighbours. The default is now True to   get the behaviour from previous version of MDAnalysis.   Note: I'm not sure if the AROUND selection is working properly at         all. It didn't work for me before and it needs to be tested         again.,0
af20b16,2008-01-31 11:53:05,python xtc reader by Benjamin Hall <hall@biop.ox.ac.uk>  (originally named xtcio.py). Used under GPL 3. This corresponds to r90 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
9109d32,2008-01-31 11:53:13,reformatted and moved some functions out of the class. Working but need to integrate into the standard MDAnalysis frame work This corresponds to r91 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
78e0581,2008-01-31 11:53:20,updated Naveen's email address and google code url This corresponds to r92 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
f76af61,2008-01-31 11:53:27,updated version to 0.5-rc1 in order to put a tar ball up on google code This corresponds to r93 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
fb1c908,2008-01-31 11:53:36,Release tar ball.  - Change version to 0.5.0  (.0 signifies alpha status  later use a1  a2  b1  b2    after the patch version)  - Added MANIFEST.in to include doc files and all the necessary header files as they are    not automatically picked up by distutils (apparently  a bug: 'getting C library   sources currently broken--no get_source_files() method in build_clib.py')   Also need to pick up all pyrex files and the docs - Revamped docs a little bit. - NOTE: python setup.py install --prefix=mydir is not working properly  it still         tries to install something in the site-wide dir   Added links to googlecode and a template for acknowledgements. - Tested the sdist and managed to compile bot on MAc OS X and Linux (CentOS 4.2 with   modern numpy (> 1.0.3)) - updated CHANGELOG This corresponds to r94 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0
3e4db21,2008-02-01 22:51:16,Make PointSelection use the periodic flag in the same way as AroundSelection  even if it's no working properly at least it's consistent.,0
792533c,2008-02-10 23:55:26,* primitive PDB writer: only works if structure was read as a pdb. It   simply replaces the pdb coordinates with the time step coordinates.   For something more complicated we should have segment and residue   lists in MDAnalysis (perhaps save them when reading the psf). * added filename attribute to both DCDReader and PDBReader to make it   easier to write unified code. The other important methods and   attributes are already identically named.,0
b53c031,2008-02-10 23:59:51,Added bfactors property to the AtomGroup. It is only set when the structure is loaded from a PDB file. The bfactors array itself is an attribute of the Universe (because it makes no sense to attach it to the time step as it is only defined for a single frame) and handled as a managed attribute in AtomGroups. (Change where bfactors[] resides?),0
67d7a1a,2008-02-11 18:23:23,numpy.array only makes a copy if you force it. This should fix the problem with AtomGroup.coordinates() function and distance_array,0
4a76bae,2008-02-20 17:10:46,added reference in docs,0
1a7b735,2008-02-20 17:13:24,new attribute 'filename' (just initializes to 'dcdfilename') (also previously added to the PDBReader class): By having a common API for PDBReader and DCDReader on can more easily write code that can transparently use either.,0
49099c9,2008-02-20 17:19:37,Allow an empty AtomGroup (removed the check for length < 1) so that one can have intermediate selections that don't select anything. This can be useful in 'or'ed selections.,0
85b6118,2008-02-20 17:26:10,House keeping: - added generated files to svn:ignore - added a little bit to TODO and made sure that it gets into the tar ball,0
bf338f5,2008-02-25 00:43:35,"Issue #6: ""accessing coordinate functions of universe segments fails"" was caused by my previous skipping of the check for an empty AtomGroup. Reverted to previous version.",0
4bbbabf,2008-02-25 02:07:17,Added Ben's authorship.,0
b0b650e,2008-02-28 02:32:18,streamlined,0
0c907a8,2008-02-28 02:35:29,Universe: Convenience functionality for interactive work: if the dcd argument has a extension 'pdb' then we try to load it as a pdb. The dcd exception handling is not robust enough yet (e.g. segmentation faults occur when accessing self.dcd after erroneously loading a dcd) so we cannot do a simple try: load_dcd() ... except IOError.,0
2fb5875,2008-02-28 02:45:34,Fixed: check for dcd extension always failed,0
0e1f31a,2008-05-18 13:19:06,Added ID keyword,0
57a2bbb,2008-05-18 13:21:30,Universe now knows the filename of the psf file it was built from  dcd and pdb instances also have the filename attribute.,0
d70bb1c,2008-06-22 03:59:51,fixed: exception did not display psf file name,0
63e9b86,2008-06-22 04:07:02,* new water dipole correl time series: calculates the vector of   the dipole moment of a rigid 3-site water model * sanitized formatting of correl.h (sorry) * started using specific Exceptions instead of the generic one,0
37c0aa0,2008-07-01 21:52:54,Moved the distance array workaround into the function itself: we simply copy the arrays ourselves and all seems to be fine. For daring souls we provide copy=False and disclaim all responsibility.,0
2a09f62,2008-07-15 16:04:08,Only provide setup.cfg.template and let the user copy and modify it. This is better because otherwise local modifications mess up svn.,0
4dc0d3d,2008-08-23 00:36:29,Release 0.5.1: bugfixes and some enhancements that accrued over the last few months (see CHANGELOG for details). - LICENSE was updated with the UIUC Open Source License (catdcd code) - updated email addresses etc in README - updated TODO (distance_array bug fixed) - added keyword expansion for some of the doc files so that Id lines are   properly shown,0
5b1fe77,2010-04-01 22:01:45,Merge branch 'rel-0.6.0',0
01369f4,2010-04-06 18:35:43,reverted pyrex for-loop syntax to be compatible with old pyrex 9.6.x,0
0adf5d2,2010-04-06 18:47:50,removed empty python dir (should have done this with the 0.6.0 release),0
d06aa63,2010-04-08 16:59:48,FIXED: problem in PDB.PDBWriter  also bumped version as we are working towards 0.6.1,0

f196e19,2010-04-30 21:42:55,Merge branch 'orbeckst',0
ef40fc0,2010-04-30 22:08:33,added patches that were lost in the last orbeckst -> trunk merge - crucial fix of old pyrex loops in src/dcd/dcdtimeseries.pyx - experimental HBond.py re-added - fixed date in CHANGELOG...,0
cadb75b,2010-05-01 03:57:38,reSTified docs and added stub for flag to convert Gromacs nm to A,0
c5b7c4a,2010-05-01 05:27:04,Gromacs trajectories fixes and improvements - FIXED: trr/xtc tests failed (on Mac OS X) when MDAnalysis was properly installed as a egg directory but not as a developer install: - forgot to include the trr and xtc files in the package - learned that xdrfile_open() segfaults (at least Mac OS X) if there is no file: added additional check to prevent that - Gromacs XDR reader now behave like DCDReader: (1) raise IOError when done  (2) continue raising with repeated next() - for some reason  TRR files can (always??) return status exdrINT at end of file  catch this in _read_next_timestep() - regenerated swig files from libxdrfile.i (only minor doc things),0
94995d3,2010-05-01 05:27:11,notes on what to do when unittests are not running,0
5cc4ef5,2010-05-01 20:36:51,bumped release but include devel,0
cb62c94,2010-05-01 20:36:57,fixed syntax error in test cases (lost the commit somewhere...),0
5a66788,2010-05-01 20:37:02,self_distance_array() docs: clarified input/output requirements (different from distance_array()!,0
24827d9,2010-05-01 20:37:07,unittests: new tests for distance_array() and self_distance_array() - added distance array tests  including known failures with copy=False - classified the XTC/TRR tests as slow - updated docs on testing considerably - moved filenames needed for all unittests into separate module NOTE: test target values were obtaine on my Macbook running python 2.6  OS X 10.6.3  this version of MDAnalysis  the should probably be checked against independent evidence such as VMD measure().,0
6ba94a7,2010-05-05 03:04:10,libxdr: added function to count the number of frames in a trajectory - read_xtc_numframes() and read_trr_numframes() do the brain-damaged thing and   iterate through all frames  in particular for trr one should be able to do better - maybe cache the frame offsets and in this way implement random access (LOOS seems to be doing   something like this) - added a few simple test cases,0
b1eace6,2010-05-05 03:04:20,added numframes to TrjReader as a cached attribute - can get numframes for XTC/TRR but takes a long time when accessed the first time - added test cases - broke correl test case into individual test cases,0
1d76f09,2010-05-05 22:08:20,trajectory API: additions - delta and skip_timestep added (compute for XDR trj  hard-code for   single frame formats  read as usual from DCD header) - units: describe the length and time units used (for possible   later automatic conversions) - deprecated DCDReader.dcd_header(): not part of API and not really   supported for XDR  also broken  see Issue 27,0

d93d7b2,2010-05-05 22:08:37,units and unit conversion added - simple conversion facility for units (length  time) in core.units (taken from my hop package) - flag[convert_gromacs_lengths] is set to True: the XTC and TRR reader (tested) and writer (untested)   automatically convert to the base units - define MDAnalysis base units as ps and Angstrom (in flags[]) - added test cases (all pass),0

2727bf7,2010-08-22 05:31:06,created MDAnalysis.analysis.distances which simply imports from core.distances - distances are useful analysis functions so most people would expect them under analysis - distances are also used for selections so that is why we keep them in core,0
12d816e,2010-08-22 05:31:17,Trajectory API: format is now UPPERCASE - the format specifier has been changed to the upper case extension (to be   consistent in naming) - added single frame writers to API definition - new get_writer_for() convenience function - refactored check for compressed file formats into check_compressed_format(),0
d014d41,2010-08-22 05:31:25,FIXED Issue 37: simulation box were not converted - added coordinates.core.triclinic_box() and triclinic_vectors() to handle conversion - added function convert_dimensions_to_unitcell() to Writers   and added to the requirements of the Trajectory API - GROWriter: introduced a temporary GROWriterStandard class which will replace the current   GROWriter (which got a DeprecationWarning),0
2c5c85f,2010-08-22 06:36:38,dcd-to-xtc conversion working - added example script dcd2xtc.py - hacked a few fixes into the xdr writer to substitute missing parameters   (maybe need to do something similar of dcd writer...) - not well tested,0
cf5b272,2010-08-25 01:56:34,Primitive PDB parser that reads simple PDB without a fuzz - added PrimitivePDBReader and parser which just stupidly   read a well-formatted pdb file without raising a stink if the resids   are oddly numbered or multiple atom names occur in the same residue - added permissive=False (default) flag to Universe  True switches on   the primitive readers (right now  only PDB has this distinction) - moved the guess_atom_type/mass/charge functions from PDB into topology.core - added permissive keyword arg to the get_parser_for() and get_reader_for()   functions - added a second dictionary each for the permissive parsers and readers (a bit   of an ugly hack...) - added unit tests for the primitive PDBReader/parser (and all pass),0

319e53c,2010-10-03 17:28:45,Summary: patch to resolve issue 43--whitespace is no longer required around the parentheses in selectAtoms strings. In module MDAnalysis/core/Selection.py and class SelectionParser  the method parse(self selectstr) now adds bounding whitespace around the input string so the parser can handle a lack of whitespace. Method __consume_token(self) in the same class has also been streamlined to incorporate the built-in pop() method rather than the more verbose alternative in place. The changes pass the unit test introduced in r456 and the enhancement has been added to the CHANGELOG.,0

529a2bf,2010-10-11 02:02:51,added centroid() to AtomGroup and Atom - synonym for centerOfGeometry() and pos - allows using Atoms instead of AtomGroups in the translate() and rotateby()   methods,0

4e727ff,2010-10-11 22:06:46,FIXED Issue 47 (attribute residue selection from segname now always returns a ResidueGroup) - changes old undocumented behaviour and MIGHT BREAK CODE - also documented the Segment.r<resid> selection but made it 1-based   (makes more sense from the user point of view as all structures/topologies start   numbering at 1 and not at 0 - updated CHANGELOG - tests pass (including the one for Issue 47),0

3689a06,2010-10-15 01:45:31,New SegmentGroup  residues and segments attributes return the corresponding group - improves the uniformity for access to the hierarchy - added new warning SelectionWarning - added docs and explained Universe > Segment >Residue > Atom hierarchy - added testcases for Atom and the hierarch attributes,0
d099b49,2010-10-15 01:45:46,hierarchy made more consistent: AtomGroup.atoms is now a AtomGroup - AtomGroup.atoms is managed attribute - atom list (immutable  the old AG.atoms) is now AG._atoms - reSTified docs - use @property where possible in AtomGroup.py - adjusetd AG testcase,0

fba0d98,2010-10-20 10:39:30,completed FIX of Issue 45 - delete universes in tearDown() AND any references held in other data structures - reduced the maximum memory footprint to <512MB (roughly) of one test process - tests run faster again (with --processes=2 I get 109s on my MacBook Pro 2-core for ~170 tests,0

0a73248,2010-10-25 12:27:35,added start_logging() and stop_logging() functions to top level - simple setup for a default logger - must be manually activated or a script must setup its own logger (see docs),0

b37a7b5,2010-10-30 13:03:25,CHARMM CRD format: fixed a few inconsistencies in the Writer - TotRes is really 5 digits wide (not 4)  - x y z are 10 wide (not 9) - should have been not really a problem because we had simply padded the   fields so everything was in the right colum  technically  one could have had problems for totres > 9999   and coordinates >99999.999 - make sure to strip to larger values when writing extended format,0
8bfa301,2010-10-30 13:03:32,tests: made coordinates test work consistently  also for crd - changed precisions to match the file format (e.g. 3 for pdb and 5   for crd)  otherwise the tests do not pass consistently) - new crd file that matches the small pdb so that we can use the same   tester class,0

b869469,2010-10-31 00:29:18,Trajectory API: clarified use of Writer write() method in response to Issue 49 - no code changes  only docs - Trajectory writers can take a Timestep as a rgument to write() - Frame writers only take a AtomGroup or a Universe for write(),0

6ff313f,2010-10-31 00:29:34,Frame writer can take a Universe (fixes one half of Issue 49) - added universe attribute to Universe - altered GRO  CRD  and PrimitivePDB writer so that they can   deal with a Universe as argument (just get the coordinates from   the atoms instead of the 'selection' --- no performance penalty    just making use of the improved hierarchy and the fact that   .atoms is now a true AtomGroup) - added test case (passes),0
7129ae7,2010-11-01 22:10:11,use PrimitivePDBReader as default PDB reader - Bio.PDB's reader can drop atoms when they have the same name   in a residue (which happens for systems generated from MD simulations)   The PrimitivePDBReader copes just fine with thos cases (but does   not handle esoteric PDB features such as alternative atoms and   insertion codes that are not needed for handling MD simulation data). - The default behaviour of MDAnalysis can be set through the flag       MDAnalysis.core.flag['permissive_pdb_reader']   The default is True. - One can always manually select the PDB reader by providing the   permissive keyword to Universe  e.g. Universe(... permissive=False)   will read the input file with the Bio.PDB reader. This might be   useful when processing true Protein Databank PDB files.,0

23a1bb7,2011-03-11 01:52:59,Support for PDBs with 4 character resnames and segID output when writing (PrimitivePDBWriter) (Issue 63  patch by dcaplan) - When I try to read and write PDBs with 4 character resnames used in NAMD/VMD I end up with an improperly formatted PDB file. This is also an issue with segIDs not being written. - I've made a quick patch where I add support for 4 character resnames and change the format string for the output to write the segID. I also added very simple support for better guessing of atom types since the function guess_atom_type was just returning 0. - I'm still not sure about how to deal with the 2 types of format strings for writing PDBs.,0

61add54,2011-03-19 05:00:51,topology: moved atom types and masses into separate tables - new topology.tables module (can be later expanded to read tables from files) - added more masses and atom types (using CHARMM top_all27 and Gromacs atommass.dat) - added unit tests for masses (note: atomtype/masses test cases are incomplete... TODO)- new functions: get_atom_mass() and guess_atom_element() that do not do much yet  but will allow finer grained control later,0
3f58920,2011-03-21 00:47:42,added reST docs for topology modules  including the hard-coded tables,0

9ecb534,2011-03-21 18:12:57,new attributes for Atom: radius and bfactor - enhanced Atom object with the radius value (read by the PQR reader) and   added radii() to AtomGroup  this should make it easier to handle PQR files - changed the way that B-factors were stored: they are now also store with   each individual Atom. For compatibility with the old behaviour  AtomGroup.bfactors   is still a (managed) attribute but this will likely be changed to a method in   the 0.8 release to have a more uniform interface - Fixed a bug with the Bio.PDB reader: in the absence of a segid in the file it   would throw an error,0

db97ed4,2011-03-30 18:12:41,analysis.align: streamlined rms_fit_trj() and alignto()  use common 'select' interface - consistent usage of 'mobile' and 'reference' set - fasta2select() returns dict with 'mobile' and 'reference' keys (MIGHT BREAK OLD   CODE ... but I don't think anyone used this) - the common select code _process_selection() has a hack to accept the old   'target' key instead of 'mobile' until 0.8 - test cases: added unit test for rmsd() and had to adjust the value for   the rms_fit_trj() test case (not really sure why but at least it's consistent   with what VMD shows),0

d1ffce7,2011-04-09 22:34:12,fixed Issue 57: optimized patch and added test case - moved the coordinate check out of the loop and test the whole coordinate array in one   go (better performance but error reporting is worse because we do not report the offending   atom anymore) - remove the opened PDB file before raising the ValueError - added test case (should have had one for PrimitivePDBWriter anyway...),0
241afbf,2011-04-09 22:34:19,relaxed test for MDAnalysis.analysis.align.rmsd: rmsd(A B) == rmsd(B A) only has to be equal to 5 decimals (jandom reported some spurious test failures in Issue 57),0

f0b2076,2011-04-10 12:20:45,patch 57b by jandom: completes the fix of Issue 57 (coordinate checking of GRO/PDB writers) - From http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/gro.html    - position (in nm  x y z in 3 columns  each 8 positions with 3 decimal places)    - velocity (in nm/ps (or km/s)  x y z in 3 columns  each 8 positions with 4 decimal places)   Does that mean a max values of 9999.999/-999.999 for coords and same for velocities  but with the decimal moved a digit to left? - added validation for gro writing  moved the coordinate checking method to parent writer class.,0
3ace9d4,2011-04-10 12:20:57,"test case for writing GRO files and optimization of fixes for Issue 57 - testing for writing GRO and limits ( -999.994 nm < x < 9999.994 nm ) - sharpened test for PDB limits ( -999.994 A < x < 9999.994 A)  note units A vs nm - conceivably we could include the boundaries into the legal values (they still round down)    if we do then we need to adjust the tests - legal coordinates check for GRO: moved out to before the file is even opened so we can get   rid of removing the opened file - GRO writer: use ""with open() as ..."" instead of ""try: ... finally: close()""",0
46cc00d,2011-04-10 13:05:51,changed legal coordinate values for GRO and PDB - limits -999.9995/9999.9995 - changed the actual check to min < x <= max (see Issue 57 comment #7) - tests: the min test is ok  the max test relies on <= and somehow does not   sharply discriminate  e.g. for GRO 9999.9996 passes and for PDB 9999.9951   passes. Not sure what's going on but I made the tests a little bit weaker   (PDB: 9999.996  GRO: 9999.999). In practice it probably won't matter...,0
