5d3d53e,2011-03-22 16:23:33,Modified the write_offline_data_to_files and read_offline_data_from_files methods in rbOOmit. They now take an extra argument (with default value ALL_DATA) that indicates whether we should write out all the data  or just the basis function (in)dependent subset. Also  the greedy_params vector has been moved from RBSystem to RBEvaluation since each basis is generated with a different set of greedy parameters in general.,0

48ab641,2011-03-30 16:36:44,Some small changes to the RB classes. In particular  made residual_scaling_denom return alpha_LB rather than sqrt alpha_LB  since that is the appropriate default for a coercive problem.,0

a75d28a,2011-03-31 21:06:34,Bug fixes and workarounds for serial output of ParallelMesh.  We no longer require the user to allgather() by hand  so now ParallelMesh users can use serializing I/O safely and will benefit when it gets more parallelized under the hood.,0

93e75b7,2011-04-05 15:11:08,Removed the QNTransient classes from rbOOmit. These classes are too specific to live in libMesh  they should be viewed more as an rbOOmit-based application code. Also  wrapped F_q  A_q and M_q representor initializations in if-tests to prevent potential memory leaks.,0
7cd6c0e,2011-04-05 18:20:52,rbOOmit change: Pulled the basis dependent Riesz representors out of RBSystem and subclasses  and moved them into RBEvaluation and subclasses.,0
4d0879d,2011-04-05 20:14:02,Cleaned up the code for clearing RB systems. It can mostly now be done by clearing the associated RBEvaluation object  do not need the complicated clear_basis_dependent_data etc any more.,0
4f1d850,2011-04-06 03:39:56,Added clear_riesz_representors() to RBEvaluation to clear the Riesz representor vectors used in computing the residual in the RB method. This can allow us to save memory when we train many bases.,0

ae0f470,2011-04-07 22:19:52,rbOOmit change: added resize_RB_data in RBEvaluation  which clears and resizes all the data that depends on the reduced basis space. This allows us to change the amount of data a given RBEvaluation can hold.,0
9b8ca55,2011-04-08 13:22:07,fix newline warning,0
cfbe357,2011-04-08 15:16:57,return value warning on gcc-4.1 fixed.,0
2e4be07,2011-04-08 22:44:43,If we read system data from a file that has fewer variables than our current system  let's remap that data onto our own variables of the same name.  This enables physics-upgrading restarts.,0
23ff717,2011-04-10 20:52:31,Major rbOOmit revision: removed the function-pointer based assembly and replaced it with object-based assembly via RBTheta and ElemAssembly. This approach is much more flexible. Made corresponding changes in ex23.,0
